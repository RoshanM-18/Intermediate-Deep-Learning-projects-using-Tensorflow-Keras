              "\"The Tragedie of HamletActus Primus. Scoena Prima.Enter Barnardo and Francisco two Centinels.  Barnardo. Who's there?  Fran. Nay answer me: Stand & vnfoldyour selfe   Bar. Long liue the King   Fran. Barnardo?  Bar. He   Fran. You come most carefully vpon your houre   Bar. 'Tis now strook twelue, get thee to bed Francisco   Fran. For this releefe much thankes: 'Tis bitter cold,And I am sicke at heart   Barn. Haue you had quiet Guard?  Fran. Not a Mouse stirring   Barn. Well, goodnight. If you do meet Horatio andMarcellus, the Riuals of my Watch, bid them make hast.Enter Horatio and Marcellus.  Fran. I thinke I heare them. Stand: who's there?  Hor. Friends to this ground   Mar. And Leige-men to the Dane   Fran. Giue you good night   Mar. O farwel honest Soldier, who hath relieu'd you?  Fra. Barnardo ha's my place: giue you goodnight.Exit Fran.  Mar. Holla Barnardo   Bar. Say, what is Horatio there?  Hor. A peece of him   Bar. Welcome Horatio, welcome good Marcellus   Mar. What, ha's this thing appear'd againe to night   Bar. I haue seene nothing   Mar. Horatio saies, 'tis but our Fantasie,And will not let beleefe take hold of himTouching this dreaded sight, twice seene of vs,Therefore I haue intreated him alongWith vs, to watch the minutes of this Night,That if againe this Apparition come,He may approue our eyes, and speake to it   Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appeare   Bar. Sit downe a-while,And let vs once againe assaile your eares,That are so fortified against our Story,What we two Nights haue seene   Hor. Well, sit we downe,And let vs heare Barnardo speake of this   Barn. Last night of all,When yond same Starre that's Westward from the PoleHad made his course t' illume that part of HeauenWhere now it burnes, Marcellus and my selfe,The Bell then beating one   Mar. Peace, breake thee of:Enter the Ghost.Looke where it comes againe   Barn. In the same figure, like the King that's dead   Mar. Thou art a Scholler; speake to it Horatio   Barn. Lookes it not like the King? Marke it Horatio   Hora. Most like: It harrowes me with fear & wonder  Barn. It would be spoke too   Mar. Question it Horatio   Hor. What art thou that vsurp'st this time of night,Together with that Faire and Warlike formeIn which the Maiesty of buried DenmarkeDid sometimes march: By Heauen I charge thee speake   Mar. It is offended   Barn. See, it stalkes away   Hor. Stay: speake; speake: I Charge thee, speake.Exit the Ghost.  Mar. 'Tis gone, and will not answer   Barn. How now Horatio? You tremble & look pale:Is not this something more then Fantasie?What thinke you on't?  Hor. Before my God, I might not this beleeueWithout the sensible and true auouchOf mine owne eyes   Mar. Is it not like the King?  Hor. As thou art to thy selfe,Such was the very Armour he had on,When th' Ambitious Norwey combatted:So frown'd he once, when in an angry parleHe smot the sledded Pollax on the Ice.'Tis strange   Mar. Thus twice before, and iust at this dead houre,With Martiall stalke, hath he gone by our Watch   Hor. In what particular thought to work, I know not:But in the grosse and scope of my Opinion,This boades some strange erruption to our State   Mar. Good now sit downe, & tell me he that knowesWhy this same strict and most obseruant Watch,So nightly toyles the subiect of the Land,And why such dayly Cast of Brazon CannonAnd Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre:Why such impresse of Ship-wrights, whose sore TaskeDo's not diuide the Sunday from the weeke,What might be toward, that this sweaty hastDoth make the Night ioynt-Labourer with the day:Who is't that can informe me?  Hor. That can I,At least the whisper goes so: Our last King,Whose Image euen but now appear'd to vs,Was (as you know) by Fortinbras of Norway,(Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate Pride)Dar'd to the Combate. In which, our Valiant Hamlet,(For so this side of our knowne world esteem'd him)Did slay this Fortinbras: who by a Seal'd Compact,Well ratified by Law, and Heraldrie,Did forfeite (with his life) all those his LandsWhich he stood seiz'd on, to the Conqueror:Against the which, a Moity competentWas gaged by our King: which had return'dTo the Inheritance of Fortinbras,Had he bin Vanquisher, as by the same Cou'nantAnd carriage of the Article designe,His fell to Hamlet. Now sir, young Fortinbras,Of vnimproued Mettle, hot and full,Hath in the skirts of Norway, heere and there,Shark'd vp a List of Landlesse Resolutes,For Foode and Diet, to some EnterprizeThat hath a stomacke in't: which is no other(And it doth well appeare vnto our State)But to recouer of vs by strong handAnd termes Compulsatiue, those foresaid LandsSo by his Father lost: and this (I take it)Is the maine Motiue of our Preparations,The Sourse of this our Watch, and the cheefe headOf this post-hast, and Romage in the Land.Enter Ghost againe.But soft, behold: Loe, where it comes againe:Ile crosse it, though it blast me. Stay Illusion:If thou hast any sound, or vse of Voyce,Speake to me. If there be any good thing to be done,That may to thee do ease, and grace to me; speak to me.If thou art priuy to thy Countries Fate(Which happily foreknowing may auoyd) Oh speake.Or, if thou hast vp-hoorded in thy lifeExtorted Treasure in the wombe of Earth,(For which, they say, you Spirits oft walke in death)Speake of it. Stay, and speake. Stop it Marcellus   Mar. Shall I strike at it with my Partizan?  Hor. Do, if it will not stand   Barn. 'Tis heere   Hor. 'Tis heere   Mar. 'Tis gone.Exit Ghost.We do it wrong, being so MaiesticallTo offer it the shew of Violence,For it is as the Ayre, invulnerable,And our vaine blowes, malicious Mockery   Barn. It was about to speake, when the Cocke crew   Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thingVpon a fearfull Summons. I haue heard,The Cocke that is the Trumpet to the day,Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding ThroateAwake the God of Day: and at his warning,Whether in Sea, or Fire, in Earth, or Ayre,Th' extrauagant, and erring Spirit, hyesTo his Confine. And of the truth heerein,This present Obiect made probation   Mar. It faded on the crowing of the Cocke.Some sayes, that euer 'gainst that Season comesWherein our Sauiours Birch is celebrated,The Bird of Dawning singeth all night long:And then (they say) no Spirit can walke abroad,The nights are wholsome, then no Planets strike,No Faiery talkes, nor Witch hath power to Charme:So hallow'd, and so gracious is the time   Hor. So haue I heard, and do in part beleeue it.But looke, the Morne in Russet mantle clad,Walkes o're the dew of yon high Easterne Hill,Breake we our Watch vp, and by my aduiceLet vs impart what we haue seene to nightVnto yong Hamlet. For vpon my life,This Spirit dumbe to vs, will speake to him:Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,As needfull in our Loues, fitting our Duty?  Mar. Let do't I pray, and I this morning knowWhere we shall finde him most conueniently.Exeunt.Scena Secunda.Enter Claudius King of Denmarke, Gertrude the Queene, Hamlet,Polonius,Laertes, and his Sister Ophelia, Lords Attendant.  King. Though yet of Hamlet our deere Brothers deathThe memory be greene: and that it vs befittedTo beare our hearts in greefe, and our whole KingdomeTo be contracted in one brow of woe:Yet so farre hath Discretion fought with Nature,That we with wisest sorrow thinke on him,Together with remembrance of our selues.Therefore our sometimes Sister, now our Queene,Th' imperiall Ioyntresse of this warlike State,Haue we, as 'twere, with a defeated ioy,With one Auspicious, and one Dropping eye,With mirth in Funerall, and with Dirge in Marriage,In equall Scale weighing Delight and DoleTaken to Wife; nor haue we heerein barr'dYour better Wisedomes, which haue freely goneWith this affaire along, for all our Thankes.Now followes, that you know young Fortinbras,Holding a weake supposall of our worth;Or thinking by our late deere Brothers death,Our State to be disioynt, and out of Frame,Colleagued with the dreame of his Aduantage;He hath not fayl'd to pester vs with Message,Importing the surrender of those LandsLost by his Father: with all Bonds of LawTo our most valiant Brother. So much for him.Enter Voltemand and Cornelius.Now for our selfe, and for this time of meetingThus much the businesse is. We haue heere writTo Norway, Vncle of young Fortinbras,Who Impotent and Bedrid, scarsely hearesOf this his Nephewes purpose, to suppresseHis further gate heerein. In that the Leuies,The Lists, and full proportions are all madeOut of his subiect: and we heere dispatchYou good Cornelius, and you Voltemand,For bearing of this greeting to old Norway,Giuing to you no further personall powerTo businesse with the King, more then the scopeOf these dilated Articles allow:Farewell, and let your hast commend your duty   Volt. In that, and all things, will we shew our duty   King. We doubt it nothing, heartily farewell.Exit Voltemand and Cornelius.And now Laertes, what's the newes with you?You told vs of some suite. What is't Laertes?You cannot speake of Reason to the Dane,And loose your voyce. What would'st thou beg Laertes,That shall not be my Offer, not thy Asking?The Head is not more Natiue to the Heart,The Hand more instrumentall to the Mouth,Then is the Throne of Denmarke to thy Father.What would'st thou haue Laertes?  Laer. Dread my Lord,Your leaue and fauour to returne to France,From whence, though willingly I came to DenmarkeTo shew my duty in your Coronation,Yet now I must confesse, that duty done,My thoughts and wishes bend againe towards France,And bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon   King. Haue you your Fathers leaue?What sayes Pollonius?  Pol. He hath my Lord:I do beseech you giue him leaue to go   King. Take thy faire houre Laertes, time be thine,And thy best graces spend it at thy will:But now my Cosin Hamlet, and my Sonne?  Ham. A little more then kin, and lesse then kinde   King. How is it that the Clouds still hang on you?  Ham. Not so my Lord, I am too much i'th' Sun   Queen. Good Hamlet cast thy nightly colour off,And let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke.Do not for euer with thy veyled lidsSeeke for thy Noble Father in the dust;Thou know'st 'tis common, all that liues must dye,Passing through Nature, to Eternity   Ham. I Madam, it is common   Queen. If it be;Why seemes it so particular with thee   Ham. Seemes Madam? Nay, it is: I know not Seemes:'Tis not alone my Inky Cloake (good Mother)Nor Customary suites of solemne Blacke,Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,No, nor the fruitfull Riuer in the Eye,Nor the deiected hauiour of the Visage,Together with all Formes, Moods, shewes of Griefe,That can denote me truly. These indeed Seeme,For they are actions that a man might play:But I haue that Within, which passeth show;These, but the Trappings, and the Suites of woe   King. 'Tis sweet and commendableIn your Nature Hamlet,To giue these mourning duties to your Father:But you must know, your Father lost a Father,That Father lost, lost his, and the Suruiuer boundIn filiall Obligation, for some termeTo do obsequious Sorrow. But to perseuerIn obstinate Condolement, is a courseOf impious stubbornnesse. 'Tis vnmanly greefe,It shewes a will most incorrect to Heauen,A Heart vnfortified, a Minde impatient,An Vnderstanding simple, and vnschool'd:For, what we know must be, and is as commonAs any the most vulgar thing to sence,Why should we in our peeuish OppositionTake it to heart? Fye, 'tis a fault to Heauen,A fault against the Dead, a fault to Nature,To Reason most absurd, whose common TheameIs death of Fathers, and who still hath cried,From the first Coarse, till he that dyed to day,This must be so. We pray you throw to earthThis vnpreuayling woe, and thinke of vsAs of a Father; For let the world take note,You are the most immediate to our Throne,And with no lesse Nobility of Loue,Then that which deerest Father beares his Sonne,Do I impart towards you. For your intentIn going backe to Schoole in Wittenberg,It is most retrograde to our desire:And we beseech you, bend you to remaineHeere in the cheere and comfort of our eye,Our cheefest Courtier Cosin, and our Sonne   Qu. Let not thy Mother lose her Prayers Hamlet:I prythee stay with vs, go not to Wittenberg   Ham. I shall in all my bestObey you Madam   King. Why 'tis a louing, and a faire Reply,Be as our selfe in Denmarke. Madam come,This gentle and vnforc'd accord of HamletSits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,No iocond health that Denmarke drinkes to day,But the great Cannon to the Clowds shall tell,And the Kings Rouce, the Heauens shall bruite againe,Respeaking earthly Thunder. Come away.Exeunt.Manet Hamlet.  Ham. Oh that this too too solid Flesh, would melt,Thaw, and resolue it selfe into a Dew:Or that the Euerlasting had not fixtHis Cannon 'gainst Selfe-slaughter. O God, O God!How weary, stale, flat, and vnprofitableSeemes to me all the vses of this world?Fie on't? Oh fie, fie, 'tis an vnweeded GardenThat growes to Seed: Things rank, and grosse in NaturePossesse it meerely. That it should come to this:But two months dead: Nay, not so much; not two,So excellent a King, that was to thisHiperion to a Satyre: so louing to my Mother,That he might not beteene the windes of heauenVisit her face too roughly. Heauen and EarthMust I remember: why she would hang on him,As if encrease of Appetite had growneBy what is fed on; and yet within a month?Let me not thinke on't: Frailty, thy name is woman.A little Month, or ere those shooes were old,With which she followed my poore Fathers bodyLike Niobe, all teares. Why she, euen she.(O Heauen! A beast that wants discourse of ReasonWould haue mourn'd longer) married with mine Vnkle,My Fathers Brother: but no more like my Father,Then I to Hercules. Within a Moneth?Ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous TearesHad left the flushing of her gauled eyes,She married. O most wicked speed, to postWith such dexterity to Incestuous sheets:It is not, nor it cannot come to good.But breake my heart, for I must hold my tongue.Enter Horatio, Barnardo, and Marcellus.  Hor. Haile to your Lordship   Ham. I am glad to see you well:Horatio, or I do forget my selfe   Hor. The same my Lord,And your poore Seruant euer   Ham. Sir my good friend,Ile change that name with you:And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio?Marcellus   Mar. My good Lord   Ham. I am very glad to see you: good euen Sir.But what in faith make you from Wittemberge?  Hor. A truant disposition, good my Lord   Ham. I would not haue your Enemy say so;Nor shall you doe mine eare that violence,To make it truster of your owne reportAgainst your selfe. I know you are no Truant:But what is your affaire in Elsenour?Wee'l teach you to drinke deepe, ere you depart   Hor. My Lord, I came to see your Fathers Funerall   Ham. I pray thee doe not mock me (fellow Student)I thinke it was to see my Mothers Wedding   Hor. Indeed my Lord, it followed hard vpon   Ham. Thrift thrift Horatio: the Funerall Bakt-meatsDid coldly furnish forth the Marriage Tables;Would I had met my dearest foe in heauen,Ere I had euer seene that day Horatio.My father, me thinkes I see my father   Hor. Oh where my Lord?  Ham. In my minds eye (Horatio)  Hor. I saw him once; he was a goodly King   Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all:I shall not look vpon his like againe   Hor. My Lord, I thinke I saw him yesternight   Ham. Saw? Who?  Hor. My Lord, the King your Father   Ham. The King my Father?  Hor. Season your admiration for a whileWith an attent eare; till I may deliuerVpon the witnesse of these Gentlemen,This maruell to you   Ham. For Heauens loue let me heare   Hor. Two nights together, had these Gentlemen(Marcellus and Barnardo) on their WatchIn the dead wast and middle of the nightBeene thus encountred. A figure like your Father,Arm'd at all points exactly, Cap a Pe,Appeares before them, and with sollemne marchGoes slow and stately: By them thrice he walkt,By their opprest and feare-surprized eyes,Within his Truncheons length; whilst they bestil'dAlmost to Ielly with the Act of feare,Stand dumbe and speake not to him. This to meIn dreadfull secrecie impart they did,And I with them the third Night kept the Watch,Whereas they had deliuer'd both in time,Forme of the thing; each word made true and good,The Apparition comes. I knew your Father:These hands are not more like   Ham. But where was this?  Mar. My Lord vpon the platforme where we watcht   Ham. Did you not speake to it?  Hor. My Lord, I did;But answere made it none: yet once me thoughtIt lifted vp it head, and did addresseIt selfe to motion, like as it would speake:But euen then, the Morning Cocke crew lowd;And at the sound it shrunke in hast away,And vanisht from our sight   Ham. Tis very strange   Hor. As I doe liue my honourd Lord 'tis true;And we did thinke it writ downe in our dutyTo let you know of it   Ham. Indeed, indeed Sirs; but this troubles me.Hold you the watch to Night?  Both. We doe my Lord   Ham. Arm'd, say you?  Both. Arm'd, my Lord   Ham. From top to toe?  Both. My Lord, from head to foote   Ham. Then saw you not his face?  Hor. O yes, my Lord, he wore his Beauer vp   Ham. What, lookt he frowningly?  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow then in anger   Ham. Pale, or red?  Hor. Nay very pale   Ham. And fixt his eyes vpon you?  Hor. Most constantly   Ham. I would I had beene there   Hor. It would haue much amaz'd you   Ham. Very like, very like: staid it long?  Hor. While one with moderate hast might tell a hundred   All. Longer, longer   Hor. Not when I saw't   Ham. His Beard was grisly? no   Hor. It was, as I haue seene it in his life,A Sable Siluer'd   Ham. Ile watch to Night; perchance 'twill wake againe   Hor. I warrant you it will   Ham. If it assume my noble Fathers person,Ile speake to it, though Hell it selfe should gapeAnd bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,If you haue hitherto conceald this sight;Let it bee treble in your silence still:And whatsoeuer els shall hap to night,Giue it an vnderstanding but no tongue;I will requite your loues; so fare ye well:Vpon the Platforme twixt eleuen and twelue,Ile visit you   All. Our duty to your Honour.Exeunt   Ham. Your loue, as mine to you: farewell.My Fathers Spirit in Armes? All is not well:I doubt some foule play: would the Night were come;Till then sit still my soule; foule deeds will rise,Though all the earth orewhelm them to mens eies.Enter.Scena TertiaEnter Laertes and Ophelia.  Laer. My necessaries are imbark't; Farewell:And Sister, as the Winds giue Benefit,And Conuoy is assistant; doe not sleepe,But let me heare from you   Ophel. Doe you doubt that?  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his fauours,Hold it a fashion and a toy in Bloude;A Violet in the youth of Primy Nature;Froward, not permanent; sweet not lastingThe suppliance of a minute? No more   Ophel. No more but so   Laer. Thinke it no more:For nature cressant does not grow alone,In thewes and Bulke: but as his Temple waxes,The inward seruice of the Minde and SouleGrowes wide withall. Perhaps he loues you now,And now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerchThe vertue of his feare: but you must feareHis greatnesse weigh'd, his will is not his owne;For hee himselfe is subiect to his Birth:Hee may not, as vnuallued persons doe,Carue for himselfe; for, on his choyce dependsThe sanctity and health of the whole State.And therefore must his choyce be circumscrib'dVnto the voyce and yeelding of that Body,Whereof he is the Head. Then if he sayes he loues you,It fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it;As he in his peculiar Sect and forceMay giue his saying deed: which is no further,Then the maine voyce of Denmarke goes withall.Then weight what losse your Honour may sustaine,If with too credent eare you list his Songs;Or lose your Heart; or your chast Treasure openTo his vnmastred importunity.Feare it Ophelia, feare it my deare Sister,And keepe within the reare of your Affection;Out of the shot and danger of Desire.The chariest Maid is Prodigall enough,If she vnmaske her beauty to the Moone:Vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes,The Canker Galls, the Infants of the SpringToo oft before the buttons be disclos'd,And in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth,Contagious blastments are most imminent.Be wary then, best safety lies in feare;Youth to it selfe rebels, though none else neere   Ophe. I shall th' effect of this good Lesson keepe,As watchmen to my heart: but good my BrotherDoe not as some vngracious Pastors doe,Shew me the steepe and thorny way to Heauen;Whilst like a puft and recklesse LibertineHimselfe, the Primrose path of dalliance treads,And reaks not his owne reade   Laer. Oh, feare me not.Enter Polonius.I stay too long; but here my Father comes:A double blessing is a double grace;Occasion smiles vpon a second leaue   Polon. Yet heere Laertes? Aboord, aboord for shame,The winde sits in the shoulder of your saile,And you are staid for there: my blessing with you;And these few Precepts in thy memory,See thou Character. Giue thy thoughts no tongue,Nor any vnproportion'd thoughts his Act:Be thou familiar; but by no meanes vulgar:The friends thou hast, and their adoption tride,Grapple them to thy Soule, with hoopes of Steele:But doe not dull thy palme, with entertainmentOf each vnhatch't, vnfledg'd Comrade. BewareOf entrance to a quarrell: but being inBear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.Giue euery man thine eare; but few thy voyce:Take each mans censure; but reserue thy iudgement:Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy;But not exprest in fancie; rich, not gawdie:For the Apparell oft proclaimes the man.And they in France of the best ranck and station,Are of a most select and generous cheff in that.Neither a borrower, nor a lender be;For lone oft loses both it selfe and friend:And borrowing duls the edge of Husbandry.This aboue all; to thine owne selfe be true:And it must follow, as the Night the Day,Thou canst not then be false to any man.Farewell: my Blessing season this in thee   Laer. Most humbly doe I take my leaue, my Lord   Polon. The time inuites you, goe, your seruants tend   Laer. Farewell Ophelia, and remember wellWhat I haue said to you   Ophe. Tis in my memory lockt,And you your selfe shall keepe the key of it   Laer. Farewell.Exit Laer.  Polon. What ist Ophelia he hath said to you?  Ophe. So please you, somthing touching the L[ord]. Hamlet   Polon. Marry, well bethought:Tis told me he hath very oft of lateGiuen priuate time to you; and you your selfeHaue of your audience beene most free and bounteous.If it be so, as so tis put on me;And that in way of caution: I must tell you,You doe not vnderstand your selfe so cleerely,As it behoues my Daughter, and your Honour.What is betweene you, giue me vp the truth?  Ophe. He hath my Lord of late, made many tendersOf his affection to me   Polon. Affection, puh. You speake like a greene Girle,Vnsifted in such perillous Circumstance.Doe you beleeue his tenders, as you call them?  Ophe. I do not know, my Lord, what I should thinke   Polon. Marry Ile teach you; thinke your selfe a Baby,That you haue tane his tenders for true pay,Which are not starling. Tender your selfe more dearly;Or not to crack the winde of the poore Phrase,Roaming it thus, you'l tender me a foole   Ophe. My Lord, he hath importun'd me with loue,In honourable fashion   Polon. I, fashion you may call it, go too, go too   Ophe. And hath giuen countenance to his speech,My Lord, with all the vowes of Heauen   Polon. I, Springes to catch Woodcocks. I doe knowWhen the Bloud burnes, how Prodigall the SouleGiues the tongue vowes: these blazes, Daughter,Giuing more light then heate; extinct in both,Euen in their promise, as it is a making;You must not take for fire. For this time Daughter,Be somewhat scanter of your Maiden presence;Set your entreatments at a higher rate,Then a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,Beleeue so much in him, that he is young,And with a larger tether may he walke,Then may be giuen you. In few, Ophelia,Doe not beleeue his vowes; for they are Broakers,Not of the eye, which their Inuestments show:But meere implorators of vnholy Sutes,Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds,The better to beguile. This is for all:I would not, in plaine tearmes, from this time forth,Haue you so slander any moment leisure,As to giue words or talke with the Lord Hamlet:Looke too't, I charge you; come your wayes   Ophe. I shall obey my Lord.Exeunt.Enter Hamlet, Horatio, Marcellus.  Ham. The Ayre bites shrewdly: is it very cold?  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager ayre   Ham. What hower now?  Hor. I thinke it lacks of twelue   Mar. No, it is strooke   Hor. Indeed I heard it not: then it drawes neere the season,Wherein the Spirit held his wont to walke.What does this meane my Lord?  Ham. The King doth wake to night, and takes his rouse,Keepes wassels and the swaggering vpspring reeles,And as he dreines his draughts of Renish downe,The kettle Drum and Trumpet thus bray outThe triumph of his Pledge   Horat. Is it a custome?  Ham. I marry ist;And to my mind, though I am natiue heere,And to the manner borne: It is a CustomeMore honour'd in the breach, then the obseruance.Enter Ghost.  Hor. Looke my Lord, it comes   Ham. Angels and Ministers of Grace defend vs:Be thou a Spirit of health, or Goblin damn'd,Bring with thee ayres from Heauen, or blasts from Hell,Be thy euents wicked or charitable,Thou com'st in such a questionable shapeThat I will speake to thee. Ile call thee Hamlet,King, Father, Royall Dane: Oh, oh, answer me,Let me not burst in Ignorance; but tellWhy thy Canoniz'd bones Hearsed in death,Haue burst their cerments, why the SepulcherWherein we saw thee quietly enurn'd,Hath op'd his ponderous and Marble iawes,To cast thee vp againe? What may this meane?That thou dead Coarse againe in compleat steele,Reuisits thus the glimpses of the Moone,Making Night hidious? And we fooles of Nature,So horridly to shake our disposition,With thoughts beyond thee; reaches of our Soules,Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we doe?Ghost beckens Hamlet.  Hor. It beckons you to goe away with it,As if it some impartment did desireTo you alone   Mar. Looke with what courteous actionIt wafts you to a more remoued ground:But doe not goe with it   Hor. No, by no meanes   Ham. It will not speake: then will I follow it   Hor. Doe not my Lord   Ham. Why, what should be the feare?I doe not set my life at a pins fee;And for my Soule, what can it doe to that?Being a thing immortall as it selfe:It waues me forth againe; Ile follow it   Hor. What if it tempt you toward the Floud my Lord?Or to the dreadfull Sonnet of the Cliffe,That beetles o're his base into the Sea,And there assumes some other horrible forme,Which might depriue your Soueraignty of Reason,And draw you into madnesse thinke of it?  Ham. It wafts me still: goe on, Ile follow thee   Mar. You shall not goe my Lord   Ham. Hold off your hand   Hor. Be rul'd, you shall not goe   Ham. My fate cries out,And makes each petty Artire in this body,As hardy as the Nemian Lions nerue:Still am I cal'd? Vnhand me Gentlemen:By Heau'n, Ile make a Ghost of him that lets me:I say away, goe on, Ile follow thee.Exeunt. Ghost & Hamlet.  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination   Mar. Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him   Hor. Haue after, to what issue will this come?  Mar. Something is rotten in the State of Denmarke   Hor. Heauen will direct it   Mar. Nay, let's follow him.Exeunt.Enter Ghost and Hamlet.  Ham. Where wilt thou lead me? speak; Ile go no further   Gho. Marke me   Ham. I will   Gho. My hower is almost come,When I to sulphurous and tormenting FlamesMust render vp my selfe   Ham. Alas poore Ghost   Gho. Pitty me not, but lend thy serious hearingTo what I shall vnfold   Ham. Speake, I am bound to heare   Gho. So art thou to reuenge, when thou shalt heare   Ham. What?  Gho. I am thy Fathers Spirit,Doom'd for a certaine terme to walke the night;And for the day confin'd to fast in Fiers,Till the foule crimes done in my dayes of NatureAre burnt and purg'd away? But that I am forbidTo tell the secrets of my Prison-House;I could a Tale vnfold, whose lightest wordWould harrow vp thy soule, freeze thy young blood,Make thy two eyes like Starres, start from their Spheres,Thy knotty and combined lockes to part,And each particular haire to stand an end,Like Quilles vpon the fretfull Porpentine:But this eternall blason must not beTo eares of flesh and bloud; list Hamlet, oh list,If thou didst euer thy deare Father loue   Ham. Oh Heauen!  Gho. Reuenge his foule and most vnnaturall Murther   Ham. Murther?  Ghost. Murther most foule, as in the best it is;But this most foule, strange, and vnnaturall   Ham. Hast, hast me to know it,That with wings as swiftAs meditation, or the thoughts of Loue,May sweepe to my Reuenge   Ghost. I finde thee apt,And duller should'st thou be then the fat weedeThat rots it selfe in ease, on Lethe Wharfe,Would'st thou not stirre in this. Now Hamlet heare:It's giuen out, that sleeping in mine Orchard,A Serpent stung me: so the whole eare of Denmarke,Is by a forged processe of my deathRankly abus'd: But know thou Noble youth,The Serpent that did sting thy Fathers life,Now weares his Crowne   Ham. O my Propheticke soule: mine Vncle?  Ghost. I that incestuous, that adulterate BeastWith witchcraft of his wits, hath Traitorous guifts.Oh wicked Wit, and Gifts, that haue the powerSo to seduce? Won to this shamefull LustThe will of my most seeming vertuous Queene:Oh Hamlet, what a falling off was there,From me, whose loue was of that dignity,That it went hand in hand, euen with the VowI made to her in Marriage; and to declineVpon a wretch, whose Naturall gifts were pooreTo those of mine. But Vertue, as it neuer wil be moued,Though Lewdnesse court it in a shape of Heauen:So Lust, though to a radiant Angell link'd,Will sate it selfe in a Celestiall bed, & prey on Garbage.But soft, me thinkes I sent the Mornings Ayre;Briefe let me be: Sleeping within mine Orchard,My custome alwayes in the afternoone;Vpon my secure hower thy Vncle stoleWith iuyce of cursed Hebenon in a Violl,And in the Porches of mine eares did poureThe leaperous Distilment; whose effectHolds such an enmity with bloud of Man,That swift as Quick-siluer, it courses throughThe naturall Gates and Allies of the body;And with a sodaine vigour it doth possetAnd curd, like Aygre droppings into Milke,The thin and wholsome blood: so did it mine;And a most instant Tetter bak'd about,Most Lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,All my smooth Body.Thus was I, sleeping, by a Brothers hand,Of Life, of Crowne, and Queene at once dispatcht;Cut off euen in the Blossomes of my Sinne,Vnhouzzled, disappointed, vnnaneld,No reckoning made, but sent to my accountWith all my imperfections on my head;Oh horrible Oh horrible, most horrible:If thou hast nature in thee beare it not;Let not the Royall Bed of Denmarke beA Couch for Luxury and damned Incest.But howsoeuer thou pursuest this Act,Taint not thy mind; nor let thy Soule contriueAgainst thy Mother ought; leaue her to heauen,And to those Thornes that in her bosome lodge,To pricke and sting her. Fare thee well at once;The Glow-worme showes the Matine to be neere,And gins to pale his vneffectuall Fire:Adue, adue, Hamlet: remember me.Enter.  Ham. Oh all you host of Heauen! Oh Earth; what els?And shall I couple Hell? Oh fie: hold my heart;And you my sinnewes, grow not instant Old;But beare me stiffely vp: Remember thee?I, thou poore Ghost, while memory holds a seateIn this distracted Globe: Remember thee?Yea, from the Table of my Memory,Ile wipe away all triuiall fond Records,All sawes of Bookes, all formes, all presures past,That youth and obseruation coppied there;And thy Commandment all alone shall liueWithin the Booke and Volume of my Braine,Vnmixt with baser matter; yes yes, by Heauen:Oh most pernicious woman!Oh Villaine, Villaine, smiling damned Villaine!My Tables, my Tables; meet it is I set it downe,That one may smile, and smile and be a Villaine;At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmarke;So Vnckle there you are: now to my word;It is; Adue, Adue, Remember me: I haue sworn't   Hor. & Mar. within.

How say you then, would heart of man once think it?But you'l be secret?  Both. I, by Heau'n, my Lord   Ham. There's nere a villaine dwelling in all DenmarkeBut hee's an arrant knaue   Hor. There needs no Ghost my Lord, come from theGraue, to tell vs this   Ham. Why right, you are i'th' right;And so, without more circumstance at all,I hold it fit that we shake hands, and part:You, as your busines and desires shall point you:For euery man ha's businesse and desire,Such as it is: and for mine owne poore part,Looke you, Ile goe pray   Hor. These are but wild and hurling words, my Lord   Ham. I'm sorry they offend you heartily:Yes faith, heartily   Hor. There's no offence my Lord   Ham. Yes, by Saint Patricke, but there is my Lord,And much offence too, touching this Vision heere:It is an honest Ghost, that let me tell you:For your desire to know what is betweene vs,O'remaster't as you may. And now good friends,As you are Friends, Schollers and Soldiers,Giue me one poore request   Hor. What is't my Lord? we will   Ham. Neuer make known what you haue seen to night   Both. My Lord, we will not   Ham. Nay, but swear't   Hor. Infaith my Lord, not I   Mar. Nor I my Lord: in faith   Ham. Vpon my sword   Marcell. We haue sworne my Lord already   Ham. Indeed, vpon my sword, Indeed   Gho. Sweare.Ghost cries vnder the Stage.  Ham. Ah ha boy, sayest thou so.

And therefore as a stranger giue it welcome.There are more things in Heauen and Earth, Horatio,Then are dream't of in our Philosophy. But come,Here as before, neuer so helpe you mercy,How strange or odde so ere I beare my selfe;(As I perchance heereafter shall thinke meetTo put an Anticke disposition on:)That you at such time seeing me, neuer shallWith Armes encombred thus, or thus, head shake;Or by pronouncing of some doubtfull Phrase;As well, we know, or we could and if we would,Or if we list to speake; or there be and if there might,Or such ambiguous giuing out to note,That you know ought of me; this not to doe:So grace and mercy at your most neede helpe you:Sweare   Ghost.

Polon. Giue him his money, and these notes Reynoldo   Reynol. I will my Lord   Polon. You shall doe maruels wisely: good Reynoldo,Before you visite him you make inquiryOf his behauiour   Reynol. My Lord, I did intend it   Polon. Marry, well said;Very well said. Looke you Sir,Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;And how, and who; what meanes; and where they keepe:What company, at what expence: and findingBy this encompassement and drift of question,That they doe know my sonne: Come you more neererThen your particular demands will touch it,Take you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him,And thus I know his father and his friends,And in part him. Doe you marke this Reynoldo?  Reynol. I, very well my Lord   Polon. And in part him, but you may say not well;But if't be hee I meane, hees very wilde;Addicted so and so; and there put on himWhat forgeries you please; marry, none so ranke,As may dishonour him; take heed of that:But Sir, such wanton, wild, and vsuall slips,As are Companions noted and most knowneTo youth and liberty   Reynol. As gaming my Lord   Polon. I, or drinking, fencing, swearing,Quarelling, drabbing. You may goe so farre   Reynol. My Lord that would dishonour him   Polon. Faith no, as you may season it in the charge;You must not put another scandall on him,That hee is open to Incontinencie;That's not my meaning: but breath his faults so quaintly,That they may seeme the taints of liberty;The flash and out-breake of a fiery minde,A sauagenes in vnreclaim'd bloud of generall assault   Reynol. But my good Lord   Polon. Wherefore should you doe this?  Reynol. I my Lord, I would know that   Polon. Marry Sir, heere's my drift,And I belieue it is a fetch of warrant:You laying these slight sulleyes on my Sonne,As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i'th' working:Marke you your party in conuerse; him you would sound,Hauing euer seene. In the prenominate crimes,The youth you breath of guilty, be assur'dHe closes with you in this consequence:Good sir, or so, or friend, or Gentleman.According to the Phrase and the Addition,Of man and Country   Reynol. Very good my Lord   Polon. And then Sir does he this?He does: what was I about to say?I was about say somthing: where did I leaue?  Reynol. At closes in the consequence:At friend, or so, and Gentleman   Polon. At closes in the consequence, I marry,He closes with you thus. I know the Gentleman,I saw him yesterday, or tother day;Or then or then, with such and such; and as you say,There was he gaming, there o'retooke in's Rouse,There falling out at Tennis; or perchance,I saw him enter such a house of saile;Videlicet, a Brothell, or so forth. See you now;Your bait of falshood, takes this Cape of truth;And thus doe we of wisedome and of reachWith windlesses, and with assaies of Bias,By indirections finde directions out:So by my former Lecture and aduiceShall you my Sonne; you haue me, haue you not?  Reynol. My Lord I haue   Polon. God buy you; fare you well   Reynol. Good my Lord   Polon. Obserue his inclination in your selfe   Reynol. I shall my Lord   Polon. And let him plye his Musicke   Reynol. Well, my Lord.Enter.Enter Ophelia.  Polon. Farewell:How now Ophelia, what's the matter?  Ophe. Alas my Lord, I haue beene so affrighted   Polon. With what, in the name of Heauen?  Ophe. My Lord, as I was sowing in my Chamber,Lord Hamlet with his doublet all vnbrac'd,No hat vpon his head, his stockings foul'd,Vngartred, and downe giued to his Anckle,Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,And with a looke so pitious in purport,As if he had been loosed out of hell,To speake of horrors: he comes before me   Polon. Mad for thy Loue?  Ophe. My Lord, I doe not know: but truly I do feare it   Polon. What said he?  Ophe. He tooke me by the wrist, and held me hard;Then goes he to the length of all his arme;And with his other hand thus o're his brow,He fals to such perusall of my face,As he would draw it. Long staid he so,At last, a little shaking of mine Arme:And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe;He rais'd a sigh, so pittious and profound,That it did seeme to shatter all his bulke,And end his being. That done, he lets me goe,And with his head ouer his shoulders turn'd,He seem'd to finde his way without his eyes,For out adores he went without their helpe;And to the last, bended their light on me   Polon. Goe with me, I will goe seeke the King,This is the very extasie of Loue,Whose violent property foredoes it selfe,And leads the will to desperate Vndertakings,As oft as any passion vnder Heauen,That does afflict our Natures. I am sorrie,What haue you giuen him any hard words of late?  Ophe. No my good Lord: but as you did command,I did repell his Letters, and deny'deHis accesse to me   Pol. That hath made him mad.I am sorrie that with better speed and iudgementI had not quoted him. I feare he did but trifle,And meant to wracke thee: but beshrew my iealousie:It seemes it is as proper to our Age,To cast beyond our selues in our Opinions,As it is common for the yonger sortTo lacke discretion. Come, go we to the King,This must be knowne, being kept close might moueMore greefe to hide, then hate to vtter loue.Exeunt.Scena Secunda.Enter King, Queene, Rosincrane, and Guildensterne Cum alijs.

Welcome good Frends:Say Voltumand, what from our Brother Norwey?  Volt. Most faire returne of Greetings, and Desires.Vpon our first, he sent out to suppresseHis Nephewes Leuies, which to him appear'dTo be a preparation 'gainst the Poleak:But better look'd into, he truly foundIt was against your Highnesse, whereat greeued,That so his Sicknesse, Age, and ImpotenceWas falsely borne in hand, sends out ArrestsOn Fortinbras, which he (in breefe) obeyes,Receiues rebuke from Norwey: and in fine,Makes Vow before his Vnkle, neuer moreTo giue th' assay of Armes against your Maiestie.Whereon old Norwey, ouercome with ioy,Giues him three thousand Crownes in Annuall Fee,And his Commission to imploy those SoldiersSo leuied as before, against the Poleak:With an intreaty heerein further shewne,That it might please you to giue quiet passeThrough your Dominions, for his Enterprize,On such regards of safety and allowance,As therein are set downe   King.

Pol. This businesse is very well ended.My Liege, and Madam, to expostulateWhat Maiestie should be, what Dutie is,Why day is day; night, night; and time is time,Were nothing but to waste Night, Day, and Time.Therefore, since Breuitie is the Soule of Wit,And tediousnesse, the limbes and outward flourishes,I will be breefe. Your Noble Sonne is mad:Mad call I it; for to define true Madnesse,What is't, but to be nothing else but mad.But let that go   Qu. More matter, with lesse Art   Pol. Madam, I sweare I vse no Art at all:That he is mad, 'tis true: 'Tis true 'tis pittie,And pittie it is true: A foolish figure,But farewell it: for I will vse no Art.Mad let vs grant him then: and now remainesThat we finde out the cause of this effect,Or rather say, the cause of this defect;For this effect defectiue, comes by cause,Thus it remaines, and the remainder thus.

But how hath she receiu'd his Loue?  Pol. What do you thinke of me?  King. As of a man, faithfull and Honourable   Pol. I wold faine proue so. But what might you think?When I had seene this hot loue on the wing,As I perceiued it, I must tell you thatBefore my Daughter told me what might youOr my deere Maiestie your Queene heere, think,If I had playd the Deske or Table-booke,Or giuen my heart a winking, mute and dumbe,Or look'd vpon this Loue, with idle sight,What might you thinke? No, I went round to worke,And (my yong Mistris) thus I did bespeakeLord Hamlet is a Prince out of thy Starre,This must not be: and then, I Precepts gaue her,That she should locke her selfe from his Resort,Admit no Messengers, receiue no Tokens:Which done, she tooke the Fruites of my Aduice,And he repulsed. A short Tale to make,Fell into a Sadnesse, then into a Fast,Thence to a Watch, thence into a Weaknesse,Thence to a Lightnesse, and by this declensionInto the Madnesse whereon now he raues,And all we waile for   King. Do you thinke 'tis this?  Qu. It may be very likely   Pol. Hath there bene such a time, I'de fain know that,That I haue possitiuely said, 'tis so,When it prou'd otherwise?  King. Not that I know   Pol. Take this from this; if this be otherwise,If Circumstances leade me, I will findeWhere truth is hid, though it were hid indeedeWithin the Center   King. How may we try it further?  Pol. You know sometimesHe walkes foure houres together, heereIn the Lobby   Qu. So he ha's indeed   Pol. At such a time Ile loose my Daughter to him,Be you and I behinde an Arras then,Marke the encounter: If he loue her not,And be not from his reason falne thereon;Let me be no Assistant for a State,And keepe a Farme and Carters   King. We will try it.Enter Hamlet reading on a Booke.  Qu. But looke where sadly the poore wretchComes reading   Pol. Away I do beseech you, both away,Ile boord him presently.Exit King & Queen.Oh giue me leaue. How does my good Lord Hamlet?  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy   Pol. Do you know me, my Lord?  Ham. Excellent, excellent well: y'are a Fishmonger   Pol. Not I my Lord   Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man   Pol. Honest, my Lord?  Ham. I sir, to be honest as this world goes, is to beeone man pick'd out of two thousand   Pol. That's very true, my Lord   Ham. For if the Sun breed Magots in a dead dogge,being a good kissing Carrion-Haue you a daughter?  Pol. I haue my Lord   Ham. Let her not walke i'thSunne: Conception is ablessing, but not as your daughter may conceiue. Friendlooke too't   Pol. How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter:yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a Fishmonger:he is farre gone, farre gone: and truly in my youth,I suffred much extreamity for loue: very neere this. Ilespeake to him againe. What do you read my Lord?  Ham. Words, words, words   Pol. What is the matter, my Lord?  Ham. Betweene who?  Pol. I meane the matter you meane, my Lord   Ham. Slanders Sir: for the Satyricall slaue saies here,that old men haue gray Beards; that their faces are wrinkled;their eyes purging thicke Amber, or Plum-TreeGumme: and that they haue a plentifull locke of Wit,together with weake Hammes. All which Sir, though Imost powerfully, and potently beleeue; yet I holde itnot Honestie to haue it thus set downe: For you yourselfe Sir, should be old as I am, if like a Crab you couldgo backward   Pol. Though this be madnesse,Yet there is Method in't: will you walkeOut of the ayre my Lord?  Ham. Into my Graue?  Pol. Indeed that is out o'th' Ayre:How pregnant (sometimes) his Replies are?A happinesse,That often Madnesse hits on,Which Reason and Sanitie could notSo prosperously be deliuer'd of.I will leaue him,And sodainely contriue the meanes of meetingBetweene him, and my daughter.My Honourable Lord, I will most humblyTake my leaue of you   Ham. You cannot Sir take from me any thing, that Iwill more willingly part withall, except my life, mylife   Polon. Fare you well my Lord   Ham. These tedious old fooles   Polon. You goe to seeke my Lord Hamlet; therehee is.Enter Rosincran and Guildensterne.  Rosin. God saue you Sir   Guild. Mine honour'd Lord?  Rosin. My most deare Lord?  Ham. My excellent good friends? How do'st thouGuildensterne? Oh, Rosincrane; good Lads: How doe yeboth?  Rosin. As the indifferent Children of the earth   Guild. Happy, in that we are not ouer-happy: on FortunesCap, we are not the very Button   Ham. Nor the Soales of her Shoo?  Rosin. Neither my Lord   Ham. Then you liue about her waste, or in the middleof her fauour?  Guil. Faith, her priuates, we   Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? Oh, most true:she is a Strumpet. What's the newes?  Rosin. None my Lord; but that the World's grownehonest   Ham. Then is Doomesday neere: But your newes isnot true. Let me question more in particular: what haueyou my good friends, deserued at the hands of Fortune,that she sends you to Prison hither?  Guil. Prison, my Lord?  Ham. Denmark's a Prison   Rosin. Then is the World one   Ham. A goodly one, in which there are many Confines,Wards, and Dungeons; Denmarke being one o'th'worst   Rosin. We thinke not so my Lord   Ham. Why then 'tis none to you; for there is nothingeither good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it isa prison   Rosin. Why then your Ambition makes it one: 'tistoo narrow for your minde   Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, andcount my selfe a King of infinite space; were it not thatI haue bad dreames   Guil. Which dreames indeed are Ambition: for thevery substance of the Ambitious, is meerely the shadowof a Dreame   Ham. A dreame it selfe is but a shadow   Rosin. Truely, and I hold Ambition of so ayry andlight a quality, that it is but a shadowes shadow   Ham. Then are our Beggers bodies; and our Monarchsand out-stretcht Heroes the Beggers Shadowes:shall wee to th' Court: for, by my fey I cannot reason?  Both. Wee'l wait vpon you   Ham. No such matter. I will not sort you with therest of my seruants: for to speake to you like an honestman: I am most dreadfully attended; but in the beatenway of friendship, What make you at Elsonower?  Rosin. To visit you my Lord, no other occasion   Ham. Begger that I am, I am euen poore in thankes;but I thanke you: and sure deare friends my thanksare too deare a halfepeny; were you not sent for? Is ityour owne inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,deale iustly with me: come, come; nay speake   Guil. What should we say my Lord?  Ham. Why any thing. But to the purpose; you weresent for; and there is a kinde confession in your lookes;which your modesties haue not craft enough to color,I know the good King & Queene haue sent for you   Rosin. To what end my Lord?  Ham. That you must teach me: but let mee coniureyou by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy ofour youth, by the Obligation of our euer-preserued loue,and by what more deare, a better proposer could chargeyou withall; be euen and direct with me, whether youwere sent for or no   Rosin. What say you?  Ham. Nay then I haue an eye of you: if you loue mehold not off   Guil. My Lord, we were sent for   Ham. I will tell you why; so shall my anticipationpreuent your discouery of your secricie to the King andQueene: moult no feather, I haue of late, but whereforeI know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custome of exercise;and indeed, it goes so heauenly with my disposition;that this goodly frame the Earth, seemes to me a sterrillPromontory; this most excellent Canopy the Ayre,look you, this braue ore-hanging, this Maiesticall Roofe,fretted with golden fire: why, it appeares no other thingto mee, then a foule and pestilent congregation of vapours.What a piece of worke is a man! how Noble inReason? how infinite in faculty? in forme and mouinghow expresse and admirable? in Action, how like an Angel?in apprehension, how like a God? the beauty of theworld, the Parragon of Animals; and yet to me, what isthis Quintessence of Dust? Man delights not me; no,nor Woman neither; though by your smiling you seemeto say so   Rosin. My Lord, there was no such stuffe in mythoughts   Ham. Why did you laugh, when I said, Man delightsnot me?  Rosin. To thinke, my Lord, if you delight not in Man,what Lenton entertainment the Players shall receiuefrom you: wee coated them on the way, and hither arethey comming to offer you Seruice   Ham. He that playes the King shall be welcome; hisMaiesty shall haue Tribute of mee: the aduenturousKnight shal vse his Foyle and Target: the Louer shallnot sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part inpeace: the Clowne shall make those laugh whose lungsare tickled a'th' sere: and the Lady shall say her mindefreely; or the blanke Verse shall halt for't: what Playersare they?  Rosin. Euen those you were wont to take delight inthe Tragedians of the City   Ham. How chances it they trauaile? their residenceboth in reputation and profit was better bothwayes   Rosin. I thinke their Inhibition comes by the meanesof the late Innouation?  Ham. Doe they hold the same estimation they didwhen I was in the City? Are they so follow'd?  Rosin. No indeed, they are not   Ham. How comes it? doe they grow rusty?  Rosin. Nay, their indeauour keepes in the wontedpace; But there is Sir an ayrie of Children, littleYases, that crye out on the top of question; andare most tyrannically clap't for't: these are now thefashion, and so be-ratled the common Stages (so theycall them) that many wearing Rapiers, are affraide ofGoose-quils, and dare scarse come thither   Ham. What are they Children? Who maintains 'em?How are they escorted? Will they pursue the Quality nolonger then they can sing? Will they not say afterwardsif they should grow themselues to common Players (asit is most like if their meanes are not better) their Writersdo them wrong, to make them exclaim against theirowne Succession   Rosin. Faith there ha's bene much to do on both sides:and the Nation holds it no sinne, to tarre them to Controuersie.There was for a while, no mony bid for argument,vnlesse the Poet and the Player went to Cuffes inthe Question   Ham. Is't possible?  Guild. Oh there ha's beene much throwing about ofBraines   Ham. Do the Boyes carry it away?  Rosin. I that they do my Lord. Hercules & his load too   Ham. It is not strange: for mine Vnckle is King ofDenmarke, and those that would make mowes at himwhile my Father liued; giue twenty, forty, an hundredDucates a peece, for his picture in Little. There is somethingin this more then Naturall, if Philosophie couldfinde it out.Flourish for the Players.  Guil. There are the Players   Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcom to Elsonower: yourhands, come: The appurtenance of Welcome, is Fashionand Ceremony. Let me comply with you in the Garbe,lest my extent to the Players (which I tell you must shewfairely outward) should more appeare like entertainmentthen yours. You are welcome: but my Vnckle Father,and Aunt Mother are deceiu'd   Guil. In what my deere Lord?  Ham. I am but mad North, North-West: when theWinde is Southerly, I know a Hawke from a Handsaw.Enter Polonius.  Pol. Well be with you Gentlemen   Ham. Hearke you Guildensterne, and you too: at eacheare a hearer: that great Baby you see there, is not yetout of his swathing clouts   Rosin. Happily he's the second time come to them: forthey say, an old man is twice a childe   Ham. I will Prophesie. Hee comes to tell me of thePlayers. Mark it, you say right Sir: for a Monday morning'twas so indeed   Pol. My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you   Ham. My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you.When Rossius an Actor in Rome-  Pol.

Seneca cannot be too heauy, nor Plautustoo light, for the law of Writ, and the Liberty. These arethe onely men   Ham. O Iephta Iudge of Israel, what a Treasure had'stthou?  Pol. What a Treasure had he, my Lord?  Ham. Why one faire Daughter, and no more,The which he loued passing well   Pol. Still on my Daughter   Ham. Am I not i'th' right old Iephta?  Polon. If you call me Iephta my Lord, I haue a daughterthat I loue passing well   Ham. Nay that followes not   Polon. What followes then, my Lord?  Ha.

Oh my olde Friend?Thy face is valiant since I saw thee last: Com'st thou tobeard me in Denmarke? What, my yong Lady and Mistris?Byrlady your Ladiship is neerer Heauen then whenI saw you last, by the altitude of a Choppine. Pray Godyour voice like a peece of vncurrant Gold be not crack'dwithin the ring. Masters, you are all welcome: wee'l e'neto't like French Faulconers, flie at any thing we see: wee'lhaue a Speech straight. Come giue vs a tast of your quality:come, a passionate speech   1.Play. What speech, my Lord?  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it wasneuer Acted: or if it was, not aboue once, for the Play Iremember pleas'd not the Million, 'twas Cauiarie to theGenerall: but it was (as I receiu'd it, and others, whoseiudgement in such matters, cried in the top of mine) anexcellent Play; well digested in the Scoenes, set downewith as much modestie, as cunning. I remember one said,there was no Sallets in the lines, to make the matter sauory;nor no matter in the phrase, that might indite theAuthor of affectation, but cal'd it an honest method. Onecheefe Speech in it, I cheefely lou'd, 'twas Aeneas Taleto Dido, and thereabout of it especially, where he speaksof Priams slaughter. If it liue in your memory, begin atthis Line, let me see, let me see: The rugged Pyrrhus liketh'Hyrcanian Beast. It is not so: it begins with PyrrhusThe rugged Pyrrhus, he whose Sable ArmesBlacke as his purpose, did the night resembleWhen he lay couched in the Ominous Horse,Hath now this dread and blacke Complexion smear'dWith Heraldry more dismall: Head to footeNow is he to take Geulles, horridly Trick'dWith blood of Fathers, Mothers, Daughters, Sonnes,Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,That lend a tyrannous, and damned lightTo their vilde Murthers, roasted in wrath and fire,And thus o're-sized with coagulate gore,With eyes like Carbuncles, the hellish PyrrhusOlde Grandsire Priam seekes   Pol. Fore God, my Lord, well spoken, with good accent,and good discretion   1.Player. Anon he findes him,Striking too short at Greekes. His anticke Sword,Rebellious to his Arme, lyes where it fallesRepugnant to command: vnequall match,Pyrrhus at Priam driues, in Rage strikes wide:But with the whiffe and winde of his fell Sword,Th' vnnerued Father fals. Then senselesse Illium,Seeming to feele his blow, with flaming topStoopes to his Bace, and with a hideous crashTakes Prisoner Pyrrhus eare. For loe, his SwordWhich was declining on the Milkie headOf Reuerend Priam, seem'd i'th' Ayre to sticke:So as a painted Tyrant Pyrrhus stood,And like a Newtrall to his will and matter, did nothing.But as we often see against some storme,A silence in the Heauens, the Racke stand still,The bold windes speechlesse, and the Orbe belowAs hush as death: Anon the dreadfull ThunderDoth rend the Region. So after Pyrrhus pause,A rowsed Vengeance sets him new a-worke,And neuer did the Cyclops hammers fallOn Mars his Armours, forg'd for proofe Eterne,With lesse remorse then Pyrrhus bleeding swordNow falles on Priam.Out, out, thou Strumpet-Fortune, all you Gods,In generall Synod take away her power:Breake all the Spokes and Fallies from her wheele,And boule the round Naue downe the hill of Heauen,As low as to the Fiends   Pol. This is too long   Ham. It shall to'th Barbars, with your beard. Prytheesay on: He's for a Iigge, or a tale of Baudry, or heesleepes. Say on; come to Hecuba   1.Play. But who, O who, had seen the inobled Queen   Ham. The inobled Queene?  Pol. That's good: Inobled Queene is good   1.Play. Run bare-foot vp and downe,Threatning the flameWith Bisson Rheume: A clout about that head,Where late the Diadem stood, and for a RobeAbout her lanke and all ore-teamed Loines,A blanket in th' Alarum of feare caught vp.Who this had seene, with tongue in Venome steep'd,'Gainst Fortunes State, would Treason haue pronounc'd?But if the Gods themselues did see her then,When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sportIn mincing with his Sword her Husbands limbes,The instant Burst of Clamour that she made(Vnlesse things mortall moue them not at all)Would haue made milche the Burning eyes of Heauen,And passion in the Gods   Pol. Looke where he ha's not turn'd his colour, andha's teares in's eyes. Pray you no more   Ham. 'Tis well, Ile haue thee speake out the rest,soone. Good my Lord, will you see the Players wel bestow'd.Do ye heare, let them be well vs'd: for they arethe Abstracts and breefe Chronicles of the time. Afteryour death, you were better haue a bad Epitaph, thentheir ill report while you liued   Pol. My Lord, I will vse them according to their desart   Ham. Gods bodykins man, better. Vse euerie manafter his desart, and who should scape whipping: vsethem after your own Honor and Dignity. The lesse theydeserue, the more merit is in your bountie. Take themin   Pol. Come sirs.Exit Polon.  Ham. Follow him Friends: wee'l heare a play to morrow.Dost thou heare me old Friend, can you play themurther of Gonzago?  Play. I my Lord   Ham. Wee'l ha't to morrow night. You could for aneed study a speech of some dosen or sixteene lines, whichI would set downe, and insert in't? Could ye not?  Play. I my Lord   Ham. Very well. Follow that Lord, and looke youmock him not. My good Friends, Ile leaue you til nightyou are welcome to Elsonower?  Rosin. Good my Lord.Exeunt.Manet Hamlet.  Ham. I so, God buy'ye: Now I am alone.Oh what a Rogue and Pesant slaue am I?Is it not monstrous that this Player heere,But in a Fixion, in a dreame of Passion,Could force his soule so to his whole conceit,That from her working, all his visage warm'd;Teares in his eyes, distraction in's Aspect,A broken voyce, and his whole Function suitingWith Formes, to his Conceit? And all for nothing?For Hecuba?What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,That he should weepe for her? What would he doe,Had he the Motiue and the Cue for passionThat I haue? He would drowne the Stage with teares,And cleaue the generall eare with horrid speech:Make mad the guilty, and apale the free,Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,The very faculty of Eyes and Eares. Yet I,A dull and muddy-metled Rascall, peakeLike Iohn a-dreames, vnpregnant of my cause,And can say nothing: No, not for a King,Vpon whose property, and most deere life,A damn'd defeate was made. Am I a Coward?Who calles me Villaine? breakes my pate a-crosse?Pluckes off my Beard, and blowes it in my face?Tweakes me by'th' Nose? giues me the Lye i'th' Throate,As deepe as to the Lungs? Who does me this?Ha? Why I should take it: for it cannot be,But I am Pigeon-Liuer'd, and lacke GallTo make Oppression bitter, or ere this,I should haue fatted all the Region KitesWith this Slaues Offall, bloudy: a Bawdy villaine,Remorselesse, Treacherous, Letcherous, kindles villaine!Oh Vengeance!Who? What an Asse am I? I sure, this is most braue,That I, the Sonne of the Deere murthered,Prompted to my Reuenge by Heauen, and Hell,Must (like a Whore) vnpacke my heart with words,And fall a Cursing like a very Drab.A Scullion? Fye vpon't: Foh. About my Braine.I haue heard, that guilty Creatures sitting at a Play,Haue by the very cunning of the Scoene,Bene strooke so to the soule, that presentlyThey haue proclaim'd their Malefactions.For Murther, though it haue no tongue, will speakeWith most myraculous Organ. Ile haue these Players,Play something like the murder of my Father,Before mine Vnkle. Ile obserue his lookes,Ile rent him to the quicke: If he but blenchI know my course. The Spirit that I haue seeneMay be the Diuell, and the Diuel hath powerT' assume a pleasing shape, yea and perhapsOut of my Weaknesse, and my Melancholly,As he is very potent with such Spirits,Abuses me to damne me. Ile haue groundsMore Relatiue then this: The Play's the thing,Wherein Ile catch the Conscience of the King.ExitEnter King, Queene, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosincrance,Guildenstern, andLords.  King. And can you by no drift of circumstanceGet from him why he puts on this Confusion:Grating so harshly all his dayes of quietWith turbulent and dangerous Lunacy   Rosin. He does confesse he feeles himselfe distracted,But from what cause he will by no meanes speake   Guil. Nor do we finde him forward to be sounded,But with a crafty Madnesse keepes aloofe:When we would bring him on to some ConfessionOf his true state   Qu. Did he receiue you well?  Rosin. Most like a Gentleman   Guild. But with much forcing of his disposition   Rosin. Niggard of question, but of our demandsMost free in his reply   Qu. Did you assay him to any pastime?  Rosin. Madam, it so fell out, that certaine PlayersWe ore-wrought on the way: of these we told him,And there did seeme in him a kinde of ioyTo heare of it: They are about the Court,And (as I thinke) they haue already orderThis night to play before him   Pol. 'Tis most true:And he beseech'd me to intreate your MaiestiesTo heare, and see the matter   King. With all my heart, and it doth much content meTo heare him so inclin'd. Good Gentlemen,Giue him a further edge, and driue his purpose onTo these delights   Rosin. We shall my Lord.Exeunt.  King. Sweet Gertrude leaue vs too,For we haue closely sent for Hamlet hither,That he, as 'twere by accident, may thereAffront Ophelia. Her Father, and my selfe (lawful espials)Will so bestow our selues, that seeing vnseeneWe may of their encounter frankely iudge,And gather by him, as he is behaued,If't be th' affliction of his loue, or no.That thus he suffers for   Qu. I shall obey you,And for your part Ophelia, I do wishThat your good Beauties be the happy causeOf Hamlets wildenesse: so shall I hope your VertuesWill bring him to his wonted way againe,To both your Honors   Ophe. Madam, I wish it may   Pol. Ophelia, walke you heere. Gracious so please yeWe will bestow our selues: Reade on this booke,That shew of such an exercise may colourYour lonelinesse. We are oft too blame in this,'Tis too much prou'd, that with Deuotions visage,And pious Action, we do surge o'reThe diuell himselfe   King. Oh 'tis true:How smart a lash that speech doth giue my Conscience?The Harlots Cheeke beautied with plaist'ring ArtIs not more vgly to the thing that helpes it,Then is my deede, to my most painted word.Oh heauie burthen!  Pol. I heare him comming, let's withdraw my Lord.Exeunt.Enter Hamlet.  Ham. To be, or not to be, that is the Question:Whether 'tis Nobler in the minde to sufferThe Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune,Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles,And by opposing end them: to dye, to sleepeNo more; and by a sleepe, to say we endThe Heart-ake, and the thousand Naturall shockesThat Flesh is heyre too? 'Tis a consummationDeuoutly to be wish'd. To dye to sleepe,To sleepe, perchance to Dreame; I, there's the rub,For in that sleepe of death, what dreames may come,When we haue shuffel'd off this mortall coile,Must giue vs pawse. There's the respectThat makes Calamity of so long life:For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time,The Oppressors wrong, the poore mans Contumely,The pangs of dispriz'd Loue, the Lawes delay,The insolence of Office, and the SpurnesThat patient merit of the vnworthy takes,When he himselfe might his Quietus makeWith a bare Bodkin? Who would these Fardles beareTo grunt and sweat vnder a weary life,But that the dread of something after death,The vndiscouered Countrey, from whose BorneNo Traueller returnes, Puzels the will,And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue,Then flye to others that we know not of.Thus Conscience does make Cowards of vs all,And thus the Natiue hew of ResolutionIs sicklied o're, with the pale cast of Thought,And enterprizes of great pith and moment,With this regard their Currants turne away,And loose the name of Action. Soft you now,The faire Ophelia? Nimph, in thy OrizonsBe all my sinnes remembred   Ophe. Good my Lord,How does your Honor for this many a day?  Ham. I humbly thanke you: well, well, well   Ophe. My Lord, I haue Remembrances of yours,That I haue longed long to re-deliuer.I pray you now, receiue them   Ham. No, no, I neuer gaue you ought   Ophe. My honor'd Lord, I know right well you did,And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd,As made the things more rich, then perfume left:Take these againe, for to the Noble mindeRich gifts wax poore, when giuers proue vnkinde.There my Lord   Ham. Ha, ha: Are you honest?  Ophe. My Lord   Ham. Are you faire?  Ophe. What meanes your Lordship?  Ham. That if you be honest and faire, your Honestyshould admit no discourse to your Beautie   Ophe. Could Beautie my Lord, haue better Comercethen your Honestie?  Ham. I trulie: for the power of Beautie, will soonertransforme Honestie from what is, to a Bawd, then theforce of Honestie can translate Beautie into his likenesse.This was sometime a Paradox, but now the time giues itproofe. I did loue you once   Ophe. Indeed my Lord, you made me beleeue so   Ham. You should not haue beleeued me. For vertuecannot so innocculate our old stocke, but we shall rellishof it. I loued you not   Ophe. I was the more deceiued   Ham. Get thee to a Nunnerie. Why would'st thoube a breeder of Sinners? I am my selfe indifferent honest,but yet I could accuse me of such things, that it were bettermy Mother had not borne me. I am very prowd, reuengefull,Ambitious, with more offences at my becke,then I haue thoughts to put them in imagination, to giuethem shape, or time to acte them in. What should suchFellowes as I do, crawling betweene Heauen and Earth.We are arrant Knaues all, beleeue none of vs. Goe thywayes to a Nunnery. Where's your Father?  Ophe. At home, my Lord   Ham. Let the doores be shut vpon him, that he mayplay the Foole no way, but in's owne house. Farewell   Ophe. O helpe him, you sweet Heauens   Ham. If thou doest Marry, Ile giue thee this Plaguefor thy Dowrie. Be thou as chast as Ice, as pure as Snow,thou shalt not escape Calumny. Get thee to a Nunnery.Go, Farewell. Or if thou wilt needs Marry, marry a fool:for Wise men know well enough, what monsters youmake of them. To a Nunnery go, and quickly too. Farwell   Ophe. O heauenly Powers, restore him   Ham. I haue heard of your pratlings too wel enough.God has giuen you one pace, and you make your selfe another:you gidge, you amble, and you lispe, and nicknameGods creatures, and make your Wantonnesse, your Ignorance.Go too, Ile no more on't, it hath made me mad.I say, we will haue no more Marriages. Those that aremarried already, all but one shall liue, the rest shall keepas they are. To a Nunnery, go.Exit Hamlet.  Ophe. O what a Noble minde is heere o're-throwne?The Courtiers, Soldiers, Schollers: Eye, tongue, sword,Th' expectansie and Rose of the faire State,The glasse of Fashion, and the mould of Forme,Th' obseru'd of all Obseruers, quite, quite downe.Haue I of Ladies most deiect and wretched,That suck'd the Honie of his Musicke Vowes:Now see that Noble, and most Soueraigne Reason,Like sweet Bels iangled out of tune, and harsh,That vnmatch'd Forme and Feature of blowne youth,Blasted with extasie. Oh woe is me,T'haue seene what I haue seene: see what I see.Enter King, and Polonius.  King. Loue? His affections do not that way tend,Nor what he spake, though it lack'd Forme a little,Was not like Madnesse. There's something in his soule?O're which his Melancholly sits on brood,And I do doubt the hatch, and the discloseWill be some danger, which to preuentI haue in quicke determinationThus set it downe. He shall with speed to EnglandFor the demand of our neglected Tribute:Haply the Seas and Countries differentWith variable Obiects, shall expellThis something setled matter in his heart:Whereon his Braines still beating, puts him thusFrom fashion of himselfe. What thinke you on't?  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I beleeueThe Origin and Commencement of this greefeSprung from neglected loue. How now Ophelia?You neede not tell vs, what Lord Hamlet saide,We heard it all. My Lord, do as you please,But if you hold it fit after the Play,Let his Queene Mother all alone intreat himTo shew his Greefes: let her be round with him,And Ile be plac'd so, please you in the eareOf all their Conference. If she finde him not,To England send him: Or confine him whereYour wisedome best shall thinke   King. It shall be so:Madnesse in great Ones, must not vnwatch'd go.Exeunt.Enter Hamlet, and two or three of the Players.  Ham. Speake the Speech I pray you, as I pronounc'dit to you trippingly on the Tongue: But if you mouth it,as many of your Players do, I had as liue the Town-Cryerhad spoke my Lines: Nor do not saw the Ayre too muchyour hand thus, but vse all gently; for in the verie Torrent,Tempest, and (as I say) the Whirle-winde ofPassion, you must acquire and beget a Temperance thatmay giue it Smoothnesse. O it offends mee to the Soule,to see a robustious Pery-wig-pated Fellow, teare a Passionto tatters, to verie ragges, to split the eares of theGroundlings: who (for the most part) are capeable ofnothing, but inexplicable dumbe shewes, & noise: I couldhaue such a Fellow whipt for o're-doing Termagant: itoutHerod's Herod. Pray you auoid it   Player. I warrant your Honor   Ham. Be not too tame neyther: but let your owneDiscretion be your Tutor. Sute the Action to the Word,the Word to the Action, with this speciall obseruance:That you ore-stop not the modestie of Nature; for anything so ouer-done, is fro[m] the purpose of Playing, whoseend both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as 'twerthe Mirrour vp to Nature; to shew Vertue her owneFeature, Scorne her owne Image, and the verie Age andBodie of the Time, his forme and pressure. Now, thisouer-done, or come tardie off, though it make the vnskilfulllaugh, cannot but make the Iudicious greeue; Thecensure of the which One, must in your allowance o'rewaya whole Theater of Others. Oh, there bee Playersthat I haue seene Play, and heard others praise, and thathighly (not to speake it prophanely) that neyther hauingthe accent of Christians, nor the gate of Christian, Pagan,or Norman, haue so strutted and bellowed, that I hauethought some of Natures Iouerney-men had made men,and not made them well, they imitated Humanity so abhominably   Play. I hope we haue reform'd that indifferently withvs, Sir   Ham. O reforme it altogether. And let those thatplay your Clownes, speake no more then is set downe forthem. For there be of them, that will themselues laugh,to set on some quantitie of barren Spectators to laughtoo, though in the meane time, some necessary Questionof the Play be then to be considered: that's Villanous, &shewes a most pittifull Ambition in the Foole that vsesit. Go make you readie.Exit Players.Enter Polonius, Rosincrance, and Guildensterne.How now my Lord,Will the King heare this peece of Worke?  Pol. And the Queene too, and that presently   Ham. Bid the Players make hast.Exit Polonius.Will you two helpe to hasten them?  Both. We will my Lord.Exeunt.Enter Horatio.  Ham. What hoa, Horatio?  Hora. Heere sweet Lord, at your Seruice   Ham. Horatio, thou art eene as iust a manAs ere my Conuersation coap'd withall   Hora. O my deere Lord   Ham. Nay, do not thinke I flatter:For what aduancement may I hope from thee,That no Reuennew hast, but thy good spiritsTo feed & cloath thee. Why shold the poor be flatter'd?No, let the Candied tongue, like absurd pompe,And crooke the pregnant Hindges of the knee,Where thrift may follow faining? Dost thou heare,Since my deere Soule was Mistris of my choyse,And could of men distinguish, her electionHath seal'd thee for her selfe. For thou hast beneAs one in suffering all, that suffers nothing.A man that Fortunes buffets, and RewardsHath 'tane with equall Thankes. And blest are those,Whose Blood and Iudgement are so well co-mingled,That they are not a Pipe for Fortunes finger.To sound what stop she please. Giue me that man,That is not Passions Slaue, and I will weare himIn my hearts Core. I, in my Heart of heart,As I do thee. Something too much of this.There is a Play to night to before the King.One Scoene of it comes neere the CircumstanceWhich I haue told thee, of my Fathers death.I prythee, when thou see'st that Acte a-foot,Euen with the verie Comment of my SouleObserue mine Vnkle: If his occulted guilt,Do not it selfe vnkennell in one speech,It is a damned Ghost that we haue seene:And my Imaginations are as fouleAs Vulcans Stythe. Giue him needfull note,For I mine eyes will riuet to his Face:And after we will both our iudgements ioyne,To censure of his seeming   Hora. Well my Lord.If he steale ought the whil'st this Play is Playing,And scape detecting, I will pay the Theft.Enter King, Queene, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosincrance,Guildensterne, andother Lords attendant with his Guard carrying Torches. DanishMarch. Sounda Flourish.  Ham. They are comming to the Play: I must be idle.Get you a place   King. How fares our Cosin Hamlet?  Ham. Excellent Ifaith, of the Camelions dish: I eatethe Ayre promise-cramm'd, you cannot feed Capons so   King. I haue nothing with this answer Hamlet, thesewords are not mine   Ham. No, nor mine. Now my Lord, you plaid oncei'th' Vniuersity, you say?  Polon. That I did my Lord, and was accounted a goodActor   Ham. And what did you enact?  Pol. I did enact Iulius Caesar, I was kill'd i'th' Capitol:Brutus kill'd me   Ham. It was a bruite part of him, to kill so Capitall aCalfe there. Be the Players ready?  Rosin. I my Lord, they stay vpon your patience   Qu. Come hither my good Hamlet, sit by me   Ha. No good Mother, here's Mettle more attractiue   Pol. Oh ho, do you marke that?  Ham. Ladie, shall I lye in your Lap?  Ophe. No my Lord   Ham. I meane, my Head vpon your Lap?  Ophe. I my Lord   Ham. Do you thinke I meant Country matters?  Ophe. I thinke nothing, my Lord   Ham. That's a faire thought to ly betweene Maids legs  Ophe. What is my Lord?  Ham. Nothing   Ophe. You are merrie, my Lord?  Ham. Who I?  Ophe. I my Lord   Ham. Oh God, your onely Iigge-maker: what shoulda man do, but be merrie. For looke you how cheerefullymy Mother lookes, and my Father dyed within's twoHoures   Ophe. Nay, 'tis twice two moneths, my Lord   Ham. So long? Nay then let the Diuel weare blacke,for Ile haue a suite of Sables. Oh Heauens! dye two monethsago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's hope, agreat mans Memorie, may out-liue his life halfe a yeare:But byrlady he must builde Churches then: or else shallhe suffer not thinking on, with the Hoby-horsse, whoseEpitaph is, For o, For o, the Hoby-horse is forgot.Hoboyes play.

Layes him downe vpon a Bankeof Flowers.She seeing him a-sleepe, leaues him. Anon comes in a Fellow,takes off hisCrowne, kisses it, and powres poyson in the Kings eares, andExits. TheQueene returnes, findes the King dead, and makes passionateAction. ThePoysoner, with some two or three Mutes comes in againe, seemingto lamentwith her. The dead body is carried away: The Poysoner Wooes theQueene withGifts, she seemes loath and vnwilling awhile, but in the end,accepts hisloue.Exeunt.  Ophe. What meanes this, my Lord?  Ham. Marry this is Miching Malicho, that meanesMischeefe   Ophe. Belike this shew imports the Argument of thePlay?  Ham. We shall know by these Fellowes: the Playerscannot keepe counsell, they'l tell all   Ophe. Will they tell vs what this shew meant?  Ham. I, or any shew that you'l shew him. Bee notyou asham'd to shew, hee'l not shame to tell you what itmeanes   Ophe. You are naught, you are naught, Ile marke thePlay.Enter Prologue.For vs, and for our Tragedie,Heere stooping to your Clemencie:We begge your hearing Patientlie   Ham. Is this a Prologue, or the Poesie of a Ring?  Ophe. 'Tis briefe my Lord   Ham. As Womans loue.Enter King and his Queene.  King. Full thirtie times hath Phoebus Cart gon round,Neptunes salt Wash, and Tellus Orbed ground:And thirtie dozen Moones with borrowed sheene,About the World haue times twelue thirties beene,Since loue our hearts, and Hymen did our handsVnite comutuall, in most sacred Bands   Bap. So many iournies may the Sunne and MooneMake vs againe count o're, ere loue be done.But woe is me, you are so sicke of late,So farre from cheere, and from your former state,That I distrust you: yet though I distrust,Discomfort you (my Lord) it nothing must:For womens Feare and Loue, holds quantitie,In neither ought, or in extremity:Now what my loue is, proofe hath made you know,And as my Loue is siz'd, my Feare is so   King. Faith I must leaue thee Loue, and shortly too:My operant Powers my Functions leaue to do:And thou shalt liue in this faire world behinde,Honour'd, belou'd, and haply, one as kinde.For Husband shalt thou-  Bap. Oh confound the rest:Such Loue, must needs be Treason in my brest:In second Husband, let me be accurst,None wed the second, but who kill'd the first   Ham. Wormwood, Wormwood   Bapt. The instances that second Marriage moue,Are base respects of Thrift, but none of Loue.A second time, I kill my Husband dead,When second Husband kisses me in Bed   King. I do beleeue you. Think what now you speak:But what we do determine, oft we breake:Purpose is but the slaue to Memorie,Of violent Birth, but poore validitie:Which now like Fruite vnripe stickes on the Tree,But fall vnshaken, when they mellow bee.Most necessary 'tis, that we forgetTo pay our selues, what to our selues is debt:What to our selues in passion we propose,The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.The violence of other Greefe or Ioy,Their owne ennactors with themselues destroy:Where Ioy most Reuels, Greefe doth most lament;Greefe ioyes, Ioy greeues on slender accident.This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strangeThat euen our Loues should with our Fortunes change.For 'tis a question left vs yet to proue,Whether Loue lead Fortune, or else Fortune Loue.The great man downe, you marke his fauourites flies,The poore aduanc'd, makes Friends of Enemies:And hitherto doth Loue on Fortune tend,For who not needs, shall neuer lacke a Frend:And who in want a hollow Friend doth try,Directly seasons him his Enemie.But orderly to end, where I begun,Our Willes and Fates do so contrary run,That our Deuices still are ouerthrowne,Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our owne.So thinke thou wilt no second Husband wed.But die thy thoughts, when thy first Lord is dead   Bap. Nor Earth to giue me food, nor Heauen light,Sport and repose locke from me day and night:Each opposite that blankes the face of ioy,Meet what I would haue well, and it destroy:Both heere, and hence, pursue me lasting strife,If once a Widdow, euer I be Wife   Ham. If she should breake it now   King. 'Tis deepely sworne:Sweet, leaue me heere a while,My spirits grow dull, and faine I would beguileThe tedious day with sleepe   Qu. Sleepe rocke thy Braine,SleepesAnd neuer come mischance betweene vs twaine.Exit  Ham. Madam, how like you this Play?  Qu. The Lady protests to much me thinkes   Ham. Oh but shee'l keepe her word   King. Haue you heard the Argument, is there no Offencein't?  Ham. No, no, they do but iest, poyson in iest, no Offencei'th' world   King. What do you call the Play?  Ham. The Mouse-trap: Marry how? Tropically:This Play is the Image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzagois the Dukes name, his wife Baptista: you shall seeanon: 'tis a knauish peece of worke: But what o'that?Your Maiestie, and wee that haue free soules, it touchesvs not: let the gall'd iade winch: our withers are vnrung.Enter Lucianus.This is one Lucianus nephew to the King   Ophe. You are a good Chorus, my Lord   Ham. I could interpret betweene you and your loue:if I could see the Puppets dallying   Ophe. You are keene my Lord, you are keene   Ham. It would cost you a groaning, to take off myedge   Ophe. Still better and worse   Ham. So you mistake Husbands.Begin Murderer. Pox, leaue thy damnable Faces, andbegin. Come, the croaking Rauen doth bellow for Reuenge   Lucian. Thoughts blacke, hands apt,Drugges fit, and Time agreeing:Confederate season, else, no Creature seeing:Thou mixture ranke, of Midnight Weeds collected,With Hecats Ban, thrice blasted, thrice infected,Thy naturall Magicke, and dire propertie,On wholsome life, vsurpe immediately.Powres the poyson in his eares.  Ham. He poysons him i'th' Garden for's estate: Hisname's Gonzago: the Story is extant and writ in choyceItalian. You shall see anon how the Murtherer gets theloue of Gonzago's wife   Ophe. The King rises   Ham. What, frighted with false fire   Qu. How fares my Lord?  Pol. Giue o're the Play   King. Giue me some Light. Away   All. Lights, Lights, Lights.Exeunt.Manet Hamlet & Horatio.  Ham. Why let the strucken Deere go weepe,The Hart vngalled play:For some must watch, while some must sleepe;So runnes the world away.Would not this Sir, and a Forrest of Feathers, if the rest ofmy Fortunes turne Turke with me; with two ProuinciallRoses on my rac'd Shooes, get me a Fellowship in a crieof Players sir   Hor. Halfe a share   Ham. A whole one I,For thou dost know: Oh Damon deere,This Realme dismantled was of Ioue himselfe,And now reignes heere.A verie verie Paiocke   Hora. You might haue Rim'd   Ham. Oh good Horatio, Ile take the Ghosts word fora thousand pound. Did'st perceiue?  Hora. Verie well my Lord   Ham. Vpon the talke of the poysoning?  Hora. I did verie well note him.Enter Rosincrance and Guildensterne.  Ham. Oh, ha? Come some Musick. Come y Recorders:For if the King like not the Comedie,Why then belike he likes it not perdie.Come some Musicke   Guild. Good my Lord, vouchsafe me a word with you   Ham. Sir, a whole History   Guild. The King, sir   Ham. I sir, what of him?  Guild. Is in his retyrement, maruellous distemper'd   Ham. With drinke Sir?  Guild. No my Lord, rather with choller   Ham. Your wisedome should shew it selfe more richer,to signifie this to his Doctor: for for me to put himto his Purgation, would perhaps plundge him into farremore Choller   Guild. Good my Lord put your discourse into someframe, and start not so wildely from my affayre   Ham. I am tame Sir, pronounce   Guild. The Queene your Mother, in most great afflictionof spirit, hath sent me to you   Ham. You are welcome   Guild. Nay, good my Lord, this courtesie is not ofthe right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholsomeanswer, I will doe your Mothers command'ment:if not, your pardon, and my returne shall bee the end ofmy Businesse   Ham. Sir, I cannot   Guild. What, my Lord?  Ham. Make you a wholsome answere: my wits diseas'd.But sir, such answers as I can make, you shal command:or rather you say, my Mother: therfore no morebut to the matter. My Mother you say   Rosin. Then thus she sayes: your behauior hath strokeher into amazement, and admiration   Ham. Oh wonderfull Sonne, that can so astonish aMother. But is there no sequell at the heeles of this Mothersadmiration?  Rosin. She desires to speake with you in her Closset,ere you go to bed   Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our Mother.Haue you any further Trade with vs?  Rosin. My Lord, you once did loue me   Ham. So I do still, by these pickers and stealers   Rosin. Good my Lord, what is your cause of distemper?You do freely barre the doore of your owne Libertie,if you deny your greefes to your Friend   Ham. Sir I lacke Aduancement   Rosin. How can that be, when you haue the voyce ofthe King himselfe, for your Succession in Denmarke?  Ham. I, but while the grasse growes, the Prouerbe issomething musty.Enter one with a Recorder.O the Recorder. Let me see, to withdraw with you, whydo you go about to recouer the winde of mee, as if youwould driue me into a toyle?  Guild. O my Lord, if my Dutie be too bold, my loueis too vnmannerly   Ham. I do not well vnderstand that. Will you playvpon this Pipe?  Guild. My Lord, I cannot   Ham. I pray you   Guild. Beleeue me, I cannot   Ham. I do beseech you   Guild. I know no touch of it, my Lord   Ham. 'Tis as easie as lying: gouerne these Ventigeswith your finger and thumbe, giue it breath with yourmouth, and it will discourse most excellent Musicke.Looke you, these are the stoppes   Guild. But these cannot I command to any vtteranceof hermony, I haue not the skill   Ham. Why looke you now, how vnworthy a thingyou make of me: you would play vpon mee; you wouldseeme to know my stops: you would pluck out the heartof my Mysterie; you would sound mee from my lowestNote, to the top of my Compasse: and there is much Musicke,excellent Voice, in this little Organe, yet cannotyou make it. Why do you thinke, that I am easier to beeplaid on, then a Pipe? Call me what Instrument you will,though you can fret me, you cannot play vpon me. Godblesse you Sir.Enter Polonius.  Polon. My Lord; the Queene would speak with you,and presently   Ham. Do you see that Clowd? that's almost in shapelike a Camell   Polon. By'th' Masse, and it's like a Camell indeed   Ham. Me thinkes it is like a Weazell   Polon. It is back'd like a Weazell   Ham. Or like a Whale?  Polon. Verie like a Whale   Ham. Then will I come to my Mother, by and by:They foole me to the top of my bent.I will come by and by   Polon. I will say so.Enter.  Ham. By and by, is easily said. Leaue me Friends:'Tis now the verie witching time of night,When Churchyards yawne, and Hell it selfe breaths outContagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood,And do such bitter businesse as the dayWould quake to looke on. Soft now, to my Mother:Oh Heart, loose not thy Nature; let not euerThe Soule of Nero, enter this firme bosome:Let me be cruell, not vnnaturall,I will speake Daggers to her, but vse none:My Tongue and Soule in this be Hypocrites.How in my words someuer she be shent,To giue them Seales, neuer my Soule consent.Enter King, Rosincrance, and Guildensterne.  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with vs,To let his madnesse range. Therefore prepare you,I your Commission will forthwith dispatch,And he to England shall along with you:The termes of our estate, may not endureHazard so dangerous as doth hourely growOut of his Lunacies   Guild. We will our selues prouide:Most holie and Religious feare it isTo keepe those many many bodies safeThat liue and feede vpon your Maiestie   Rosin. The singleAnd peculiar life is boundWith all the strength and Armour of the minde,To keepe it selfe from noyance: but much more,That Spirit, vpon whose spirit depends and restsThe liues of many, the cease of MaiestieDies not alone; but like a Gulfe doth drawWhat's neere it, with it. It is a massie wheeleFixt on the Somnet of the highest Mount.To whose huge Spoakes, ten thousand lesser thingsAre mortiz'd and adioyn'd: which when it falles,Each small annexment, pettie consequenceAttends the boystrous Ruine. Neuer aloneDid the King sighe, but with a generall grone   King. Arme you, I pray you to this speedie Voyage;For we will Fetters put vpon this feare,Which now goes too free-footed   Both. We will haste vs.Exeunt. Gent.Enter Polonius.  Pol. My Lord, he's going to his Mothers Closset:Behinde the Arras Ile conuey my selfeTo heare the Processe. Ile warrant shee'l tax him home,And as you said, and wisely was it said,'Tis meete that some more audience then a Mother,Since Nature makes them partiall, should o're-heareThe speech of vantage. Fare you well my Liege,Ile call vpon you ere you go to bed,And tell you what I know   King. Thankes deere my Lord.Oh my offence is ranke, it smels to heauen,It hath the primall eldest curse vpon't,A Brothers murther. Pray can I not,Though inclination be as sharpe as will:My stronger guilt, defeats my strong intent,And like a man to double businesse bound,I stand in pause where I shall first begin,And both neglect; what if this cursed handWere thicker then it selfe with Brothers blood,Is there not Raine enough in the sweet HeauensTo wash it white as Snow? Whereto serues mercy,But to confront the visage of Offence?And what's in Prayer, but this two-fold force,To be fore-stalled ere we come to fall,Or pardon'd being downe? Then Ile looke vp,My fault is past. But oh, what forme of PrayerCan serue my turne? Forgiue me my foule Murther:That cannot be, since I am still possestOf those effects for which I did the Murther.My Crowne, mine owne Ambition, and my Queene:May one be pardon'd, and retaine th' offence?In the corrupted currants of this world,Offences gilded hand may shoue by Iustice,And oft 'tis seene, the wicked prize it selfeBuyes out the Law; but 'tis not so aboue,There is no shuffling, there the Action lyesIn his true Nature, and we our selues compell'dEuen to the teeth and forehead of our faults,To giue in euidence. What then? What rests?Try what Repentance can. What can it not?Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?Oh wretched state! Oh bosome, blacke as death!Oh limed soule, that strugling to be free,Art more ingag'd: Helpe Angels, make assay:Bow stubborne knees, and heart with strings of Steele,Be soft as sinewes of the new-borne Babe,All may be well.Enter Hamlet.  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying,And now Ile doo't, and so he goes to Heauen,And so am I reueng'd: that would be scann'd,A Villaine killes my Father, and for thatI his foule Sonne, do this same Villaine sendTo heauen. Oh this is hyre and Sallery, not Reuenge.He tooke my Father grossely, full of bread,With all his Crimes broad blowne, as fresh as May,And how his Audit stands, who knowes, saue Heauen:But in our circumstance and course of thought'Tis heauie with him: and am I then reueng'd,To take him in the purging of his Soule,When he is fit and season'd for his passage? No.Vp Sword, and know thou a more horrid hentWhen he is drunke asleepe: or in his Rage,Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed,At gaming, swearing, or about some acteThat ha's no rellish of Saluation in't,Then trip him, that his heeles may kicke at Heauen,And that his Soule may be as damn'd and blackeAs Hell, whereto it goes.

Go, go, you question with an idle tongue   Qu. Why how now Hamlet?  Ham. Whats the matter now?  Qu. Haue you forgot me?  Ham. No by the Rood, not so:You are the Queene, your Husbands Brothers wife,But would you were not so. You are my Mother   Qu. Nay, then Ile set those to you that can speake   Ham. Come, come, and sit you downe, you shall notboudge:You go not till I set you vp a glasse,Where you may see the inmost part of you?  Qu.

Oh me, what hast thou done?  Ham. Nay I know not, is it the King?  Qu. Oh what a rash, and bloody deed is this?  Ham. A bloody deed, almost as bad good Mother,As kill a King, and marrie with his Brother   Qu. As kill a King?  Ham. I Lady, 'twas my word.Thou wretched, rash, intruding foole farewell,I tooke thee for thy Betters, take thy Fortune,Thou find'st to be too busie, is some danger.Leaue wringing of your hands, peace, sit you downe,And let me wring your heart, for so I shallIf it be made of penetrable stuffe;If damned Custome haue not braz'd it so,That it is proofe and bulwarke against Sense   Qu. What haue I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tong,In noise so rude against me?  Ham. Such an ActThat blurres the grace and blush of Modestie,Cals Vertue Hypocrite, takes off the RoseFrom the faire forehead of an innocent loue,And makes a blister there. Makes marriage vowesAs false as Dicers Oathes. Oh such a deed,As from the body of Contraction pluckesThe very soule, and sweete Religion makesA rapsidie of words. Heauens face doth glow,Yea this solidity and compound masse,With tristfull visage as against the doome,Is thought-sicke at the act   Qu. Aye me; what act, that roares so lowd, & thundersin the Index   Ham. Looke heere vpon this Picture, and on this,The counterfet presentment of two Brothers:See what a grace was seated on his Brow,Hyperions curles, the front of Ioue himselfe,An eye like Mars, to threaten or commandA Station, like the Herald MercurieNew lighted on a heauen-kissing hill:A Combination, and a forme indeed,Where euery God did seeme to set his Seale,To giue the world assurance of a man.This was your Husband. Looke you now what followes.Heere is your Husband, like a Mildew'd eareBlasting his wholsom breath. Haue you eyes?Could you on this faire Mountaine leaue to feed,And batten on this Moore? Ha? Haue you eyes?You cannot call it Loue: For at your age,The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,And waites vpon the Iudgement: and what IudgementWould step from this, to this? What diuell was't,That thus hath cousend you at hoodman-blinde?O Shame! where is thy Blush? Rebellious Hell,If thou canst mutine in a Matrons bones,To flaming youth, let Vertue be as waxe.And melt in her owne fire. Proclaime no shame,When the compulsiue Ardure giues the charge,Since Frost it selfe, as actiuely doth burne,As Reason panders Will   Qu. O Hamlet, speake no more.Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soule,And there I see such blacke and grained spots,As will not leaue their Tinct   Ham. Nay, but to liueIn the ranke sweat of an enseamed bed,Stew'd in Corruption; honying and making loueOuer the nasty Stye   Qu. Oh speake to me, no more,These words like Daggers enter in mine eares.No more sweet Hamlet   Ham. A Murderer, and a Villaine:A Slaue, that is not twentieth part the tytheOf your precedent Lord. A vice of Kings,A Cutpurse of the Empire and the Rule.That from a shelfe, the precious Diadem stole,And put it in his Pocket   Qu. No more.Enter Ghost.  Ham. A King of shreds and patches.Saue me; and houer o're me with your wingsYou heauenly Guards. What would your gracious figure?  Qu. Alas he's mad   Ham. Do you not come your tardy Sonne to chide,That laps't in Time and Passion, lets go byTh' important acting of your dread command? Oh say   Ghost. Do not forget: this VisitationIs but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.But looke, Amazement on thy Mother sits;O step betweene her, and her fighting Soule,Conceit in weakest bodies, strongest workes.Speake to her Hamlet   Ham. How is it with you Lady?  Qu. Alas, how is't with you?That you bend your eye on vacancie,And with their corporall ayre do hold discourse.Forth at your eyes, your spirits wildely peepe,And as the sleeping Soldiours in th' Alarme,Your bedded haire, like life in excrements,Start vp, and stand an end. Oh gentle Sonne,Vpon the heate and flame of thy distemperSprinkle coole patience. Whereon do you looke?  Ham. On him, on him: look you how pale he glares,His forme and cause conioyn'd, preaching to stones,Would make them capeable. Do not looke vpon me,Least with this pitteous action you conuertMy sterne effects: then what I haue to do,Will want true colour; teares perchance for blood   Qu. To who do you speake this?  Ham.

What shall I do?  Ham. Not this by no meanes that I bid you do:Let the blunt King tempt you againe to bed,Pinch Wanton on your cheeke, call you his Mouse,And let him for a paire of reechie kisses,Or padling in your necke with his damn'd Fingers,Make you to rauell all this matter out,That I essentially am not in madnesse,But made in craft. 'Twere good you let him know,For who that's but a Queene, faire, sober, wise,Would from a Paddocke, from a Bat, a Gibbe,Such deere concernings hide, Who would do so,No in despight of Sense and Secrecie,Vnpegge the Basket on the houses top:Let the Birds flye, and like the famous ApeTo try Conclusions in the Basket, creepeAnd breake your owne necke downe   Qu.

Ere we were two dayes old at Sea, a Pyrate of veryWarlicke appointment gaue vs Chace. Finding our selues tooslow of Saile, we put on a compelled Valour. In the Grapple, Iboorded them: On the instant they got cleare of our Shippe, soI alone became their Prisoner. They haue dealt with mee, likeTheeues of Mercy, but they knew what they did.

King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,And you must put me in your heart for Friend,Sith you haue heard, and with a knowing eare,That he which hath your Noble Father slaine,Pursued my life   Laer. It well appeares. But tell me,Why you proceeded not against these feates,So crimefull, and so Capitall in Nature,As by your Safety, Wisedome, all things else,You mainly were stirr'd vp?  King. O for two speciall Reasons,Which may to you (perhaps) seeme much vnsinnowed,And yet to me they are strong. The Queen his Mother,Liues almost by his lookes: and for my selfe,My Vertue or my Plague, be it either which,She's so coniunctiue to my life, and soule;That as the Starre moues not but in his Sphere,I could not but by her. The other Motiue,Why to a publike count I might not go,Is the great loue the generall gender beare him,Who dipping all his Faults in their affection,Would like the Spring that turneth Wood to Stone,Conuert his Gyues to Graces. So that my ArrowesToo slightly timbred for so loud a Winde,Would haue reuerted to my Bow againe,And not where I had arm'd them   Laer. And so haue I a Noble Father lost,A Sister driuen into desperate tearmes,Who was (if praises may go backe againe)Stood Challenger on mount of all the AgeFor her perfections. But my reuenge will come   King. Breake not your sleepes for that,You must not thinkeThat we are made of stuffe, so flat, and dull,That we can let our Beard be shooke with danger,And thinke it pastime.

Or no such thing?  Laer. Know you the hand?  Kin. 'Tis Hamlets Character, naked and in a Postscripthere he sayes alone: Can you aduise me?  Laer. I'm lost in it my Lord; but let him come,It warmes the very sicknesse in my heart,That I shall liue and tell him to his teeth;Thus diddest thou   Kin. If it be so Laertes, as how should it be so:How otherwise will you be rul'd by me?  Laer. If so you'l not o'rerule me to a peace   Kin. To thine owne peace: if he be now return'd,As checking at his Voyage, and that he meanesNo more to vndertake it; I will worke himTo an exployt now ripe in my Deuice,Vnder the which he shall not choose but fall;And for his death no winde of blame shall breath,But euen his Mother shall vncharge the practice,And call it accident: Some two Monthes henceHere was a Gentleman of Normandy,I'ue seene my selfe, and seru'd against the French,And they ran well on Horsebacke; but this GallantHad witchcraft in't; he grew into his Seat,And to such wondrous doing brought his Horse,As had he beene encorps't and demy-Natur'dWith the braue Beast, so farre he past my thought,That I in forgery of shapes and trickes,Come short of what he did   Laer. A Norman was't?  Kin. A Norman   Laer. Vpon my life Lamound   Kin. The very same   Laer. I know him well, he is the Brooch indeed,And Iemme of all our Nation   Kin. Hee mad confession of you,And gaue you such a Masterly report,For Art and exercise in your defence;And for your Rapier most especiall,That he cryed out, t'would be a sight indeed,If one could match you Sir.

Laertes was your Father deare to you?Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,A face without a heart?  Laer. Why aske you this?  Kin. Not that I thinke you did not loue your Father,But that I know Loue is begun by Time:And that I see in passages of proofe,Time qualifies the sparke and fire of it:Hamlet comes backe: what would you vndertake,To show your selfe your Fathers sonne indeed,More then in words?  Laer. To cut his throat i'th' Church   Kin. No place indeed should murder Sancturize;Reuenge should haue no bounds: but good LaertesWill you doe this, keepe close within your Chamber,Hamlet return'd, shall know you are come home:Wee'l put on those shall praise your excellence,And set a double varnish on the fameThe Frenchman gaue you, bring you in fine together,And wager on your heads, he being remisse,Most generous, and free from all contriuing,Will not peruse the Foiles? So that with ease,Or with a little shuffling, you may chooseA Sword vnbaited, and in a passe of practice,Requit him for your Father   Laer. I will doo't.And for that purpose Ile annoint my Sword:I bought an Vnction of a MountebankeSo mortall, I but dipt a knife in it,Where it drawes blood, no Cataplasme so rare,Collected from all Simples that haue VertueVnder the Moone, can saue the thing from death,That is but scratcht withall: Ile touch my point,With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,It may be death   Kin. Let's further thinke of this,Weigh what conuenience both of time and meanesMay fit vs to our shape, if this should faile;And that our drift looke through our bad performance,'Twere better not assaid; therefore this ProiectShould haue a backe or second, that might hold,If this should blast in proofe: Soft, let me seeWee'l make a solemne wager on your commings,I ha't: when in your motion you are hot and dry,As make your bowts more violent to the end,And that he cals for drinke; Ile haue prepar'd himA Challice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,Our purpose may hold there; how sweet Queene.Enter Queene.  Queen. One woe doth tread vpon anothers heele,So fast they'l follow: your Sister's drown'd Laertes   Laer. Drown'd! O where?  Queen. There is a Willow growes aslant a Brooke,That shewes his hore leaues in the glassie streame:There with fantasticke Garlands did she come,Of Crow-flowers, Nettles, Daysies, and long Purples,That liberall Shepheards giue a grosser name;But our cold Maids doe Dead Mens Fingers call them:There on the pendant boughes, her Coronet weedsClambring to hang; an enuious sliuer broke,When downe the weedy Trophies, and her selfe,Fell in the weeping Brooke, her cloathes spred wide,And Mermaid-like, a while they bore her vp,Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,As one incapable of her owne distresse,Or like a creature Natiue, and induedVnto that Element: but long it could not be,Till that her garments, heauy with her drinke,Pul'd the poore wretch from her melodious buy,To muddy death   Laer. Alas then, is she drown'd?  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd   Laer. Too much of water hast thou poore Ophelia,And therefore I forbid my teares: but yetIt is our tricke, Nature her custome holds,Let shame say what it will; when these are goneThe woman will be out: Adue my Lord,I haue a speech of fire, that faine would blaze,But that this folly doubts it.Enter.

Is she to bee buried in Christian buriall, thatwilfully seekes her owne saluation?  Other. I tell thee she is, and therefore make her Grauestraight, the Crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christianburiall   Clo. How can that be, vnlesse she drowned her selfe inher owne defence?  Other. Why 'tis found so   Clo. It must be Se offendendo, it cannot bee else: forheere lies the point; If I drowne my selfe wittingly, it arguesan Act: and an Act hath three branches. It is anAct to doe and to performe; argall she drown'd her selfewittingly   Other. Nay but heare you Goodman Deluer   Clown. Giue me leaue; heere lies the water; good:heere stands the man; good: If the man goe to this waterand drowne himselfe; it is will he nill he, he goes;marke you that? But if the water come to him & drownehim; hee drownes not himselfe. Argall, hee that is notguilty of his owne death, shortens not his owne life   Other. But is this law?  Clo. I marry is't, Crowners Quest Law   Other. Will you ha the truth on't: if this had notbeene a Gentlewoman, shee should haue beene buriedout of Christian Buriall   Clo. Why there thou say'st. And the more pitty thatgreat folke should haue countenance in this world todrowne or hang themselues, more then their euen Christian.Come, my Spade; there is no ancient Gentlemen,but Gardiners, Ditchers and Graue-makers; they hold vpAdams Profession   Other. Was he a Gentleman?  Clo. He was the first that euer bore Armes   Other. Why he had none   Clo. What, ar't a Heathen? how doth thou vnderstandthe Scripture? the Scripture sayes Adam dig'd;could hee digge without Armes? Ile put another questionto thee; if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confessethy selfe-  Other. Go too   Clo. What is he that builds stronger then either theMason, the Shipwright, or the Carpenter?  Other. The Gallowes maker; for that Frame outliues athousand Tenants   Clo. I like thy wit well in good faith, the Gallowesdoes well; but how does it well? it does well to thosethat doe ill: now, thou dost ill to say the Gallowes isbuilt stronger then the Church: Argall, the Gallowesmay doe well to thee. Too't againe, Come   Other. Who builds stronger then a Mason, a Shipwright,or a Carpenter?  Clo. I, tell me that, and vnyoake   Other. Marry, now I can tell   Clo. Too't   Other. Masse, I cannot tell.Enter Hamlet and Horatio a farre off.  Clo. Cudgell thy braines no more about it; for yourdull Asse will not mend his pace with beating; and whenyou are ask't this question next, say a Graue-maker: theHouses that he makes, lasts till Doomesday: go, get theeto Yaughan, fetch me a stoupe of Liquor.Sings.In youth when I did loue, did loue,me thought it was very sweete:To contract O the time for a my behoue,O me thought there was nothing meete   Ham. Ha's this fellow no feeling of his businesse, thathe sings at Graue-making?  Hor. Custome hath made it in him a property of easinesse   Ham. 'Tis ee'n so; the hand of little Imployment haththe daintier sense   Clowne sings. But Age with his stealing stepshath caught me in his clutch:And hath shipped me intill the Land,as if I had neuer beene such   Ham. That Scull had a tongue in it, and could singonce: how the knaue iowles it to th' grownd, as if itwere Caines Iaw-bone, that did the first murther: Itmight be the Pate of a Polititian which this Asse o're Offices:one that could circumuent God, might it not?  Hor. It might, my Lord   Ham. Or of a Courtier, which could say, Good Morrowsweet Lord: how dost thou, good Lord? thismight be my Lord such a one, that prais'd my Lord sucha ones Horse, when he meant to begge it; might it not?  Hor. I, my Lord   Ham. Why ee'n so: and now my Lady Wormes,Chaplesse, and knockt about the Mazard with a SextonsSpade; heere's fine Reuolution, if wee had the tricke tosee't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding, butto play at Loggets with 'em? mine ake to thinkeon't   Clowne sings. A Pickhaxe and a Spade, a Spade,for and a shrowding-Sheete:O a Pit of Clay for to be made,for such a Guest is meete   Ham. There's another: why might not that bee theScull of a Lawyer? where be his Quiddits now? hisQuillets? his Cases? his Tenures, and his Tricks? whydoe's he suffer this rude knaue now to knocke him aboutthe Sconce with a dirty Shouell, and will not tell him ofhis Action of Battery? hum. This fellow might be in'stime a great buyer of Land, with his Statutes, his Recognizances,his Fines, his double Vouchers, his Recoueries:Is this the fine of his Fines, and the recouery of his Recoueries,to haue his fine Pate full of fine Dirt? will hisVouchers vouch him no more of his Purchases, and doubleones too, then the length and breadth of a paire ofIndentures? the very Conueyances of his Lands willhardly lye in this Boxe; and must the Inheritor himselfehaue no more? ha?  Hor. Not a iot more, my Lord   Ham. Is not Parchment made of Sheep-skinnes?  Hor. I my Lord, and of Calue-skinnes too   Ham. They are Sheepe and Calues that seek out assurancein that. I will speake to this fellow: whose Graue'sthis Sir?  Clo. Mine Sir:O a Pit of Clay for to be made,for such a Guest is meete   Ham. I thinke it be thine indeed: for thou liest in't   Clo. You lye out on't Sir, and therefore it is not yours:for my part, I doe not lye in't; and yet it is mine   Ham. Thou dost lye in't, to be in't and say 'tis thine:'tis for the dead, not for the quicke, therefore thoulyest   Clo. 'Tis a quicke lye Sir, 'twill away againe from meto you   Ham. What man dost thou digge it for?  Clo. For no man Sir   Ham. What woman then?  Clo. For none neither   Ham. Who is to be buried in't?  Clo. One that was a woman Sir; but rest her Soule,shee's dead   Ham. How absolute the knaue is? wee must speakeby the Carde, or equiuocation will vndoe vs: by theLord Horatio, these three yeares I haue taken note of it,the Age is growne so picked, that the toe of the Pesantcomes so neere the heeles of our Courtier, hee galls hisKibe. How long hast thou been a Graue-maker?  Clo. Of all the dayes i'th' yeare, I came too't that daythat our last King Hamlet o'recame Fortinbras   Ham. How long is that since?  Clo. Cannot you tell that? euery foole can tell that:It was the very day, that young Hamlet was borne, heethat was mad, and sent into England   Ham. I marry, why was he sent into England?  Clo. Why, because he was mad; hee shall recouer hiswits there; or if he do not, it's no great matter there   Ham. Why?  Clo. 'Twill not be seene in him, there the men are asmad as he   Ham. How came he mad?  Clo. Very strangely they say   Ham. How strangely?  Clo. Faith e'ene with loosing his wits   Ham. Vpon what ground?  Clo. Why heere in Denmarke: I haue bin sixeteeneheere, man and Boy thirty yeares   Ham. How long will a man lie i'th' earth ere he rot?  Clo. Ifaith, if he be not rotten before he die (as we hauemany pocky Coarses now adaies, that will scarce holdthe laying in) he will last you some eight yeare, or nineyeare. A Tanner will last you nine yeare   Ham. Why he, more then another?  Clo. Why sir, his hide is so tan'd with his Trade, thathe will keepe out water a great while. And your water,is a sore Decayer of your horson dead body. Heres a Scullnow: this Scul, has laine in the earth three & twenty years   Ham. Whose was it?  Clo. A whoreson mad Fellowes it was;Whose doe you thinke it was?  Ham. Nay, I know not   Clo. A pestilence on him for a mad Rogue, a pour'd aFlaggon of Renish on my head once. This same ScullSir, this same Scull sir, was Yoricks Scull, the Kings Iester   Ham. This?  Clo. E'ene that   Ham. Let me see. Alas poore Yorick, I knew him Horatio,a fellow of infinite Iest; of most excellent fancy, hehath borne me on his backe a thousand times: And howabhorred my Imagination is, my gorge rises at it. Heerehung those lipps, that I haue kist I know not how oft.Where be your Iibes now? Your Gambals? YourSongs? Your flashes of Merriment that were wont toset the Table on a Rore? No one now to mock your ownIeering? Quite chopfalne? Now get you to my LadiesChamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thicke, to thisfauour she must come. Make her laugh at that: prytheeHoratio tell me one thing   Hor. What's that my Lord?  Ham. Dost thou thinke Alexander lookt o'this fashioni'th' earth?  Hor. E'ene so   Ham. And smelt so? Puh   Hor. E'ene so, my Lord   Ham. To what base vses we may returne Horatio.Why may not Imagination trace the Noble dust of Alexander,till he find it stopping a bunghole   Hor. 'Twere to consider: to curiously to consider so   Ham. No faith, not a iot. But to follow him thetherwith modestie enough, & likeliehood to lead it; as thus.Alexander died: Alexander was buried: Alexander returnethinto dust; the dust is earth; of earth we makeLome, and why of that Lome (whereto he was conuerted)might they not stopp a Beere-barrell?Imperiall Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,Might stop a hole to keepe the winde away.Oh, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,Should patch a Wall, t' expell the winters flaw.But soft, but soft, aside; heere comes the King.Enter King, Queene, Laertes, and a Coffin, with Lords attendant.The Queene, the Courtiers. Who is that they follow,And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken,The Coarse they follow, did with disperate hand,Fore do it owne life; 'twas some Estate.Couch we a while, and mark   Laer. What Cerimony else?  Ham. That is Laertes, a very Noble youth: Marke   Laer. What Cerimony else?  Priest. Her Obsequies haue bin as farre inlarg'd.As we haue warrantie, her death was doubtfull,And but that great Command, o're-swaies the order,She should in ground vnsanctified haue lodg'd,Till the last Trumpet. For charitable praier,Shardes, Flints, and Peebles, should be throwne on her:Yet heere she is allowed her Virgin Rites,Her Maiden strewments, and the bringing homeOf Bell and Buriall   Laer. Must there no more be done ?  Priest. No more be done:We should prophane the seruice of the dead,To sing sage Requiem, and such rest to herAs to peace-parted Soules   Laer. Lay her i'th' earth,And from her faire and vnpolluted flesh,May Violets spring. I tell thee (churlish Priest)A Ministring Angell shall my Sister be,When thou liest howling?  Ham. What, the faire Ophelia?  Queene. Sweets, to the sweet farewell.I hop'd thou should'st haue bin my Hamlets wife:I thought thy Bride-bed to haue deckt (sweet Maid)And not t'haue strew'd thy Graue   Laer. Oh terrible woer,Fall ten times trebble, on that cursed headWhose wicked deed, thy most Ingenious senceDepriu'd thee of. Hold off the earth a while,Till I haue caught her once more in mine armes:Leaps in the graue.Now pile your dust, vpon the quicke, and dead,Till of this flat a Mountaine you haue made,To o're top old Pelion, or the skyish headOf blew Olympus   Ham. What is he, whose griefesBeares such an Emphasis? whose phrase of SorrowConiure the wandring Starres, and makes them standLike wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,Hamlet the Dane   Laer. The deuill take thy soule   Ham. Thou prai'st not well,I prythee take thy fingers from my throat;Sir though I am not Spleenatiue, and rash,Yet haue I something in me dangerous,Which let thy wisenesse feare. Away thy hand   King. Pluck them asunder   Qu. Hamlet, Hamlet   Gen. Good my Lord be quiet   Ham. Why I will fight with him vppon this Theme.Vntill my eielids will no longer wag   Qu. Oh my Sonne, what Theame?  Ham. I lou'd Ophelia; fortie thousand BrothersCould not (with all there quantitie of Loue)Make vp my summe. What wilt thou do for her?  King. Oh he is mad Laertes,  Qu. For loue of God forbeare him   Ham. Come show me what thou'lt doe.Woo't weepe? Woo't fight? Woo't teare thy selfe?Woo't drinke vp Esile, eate a Crocodile?Ile doo't. Dost thou come heere to whine;To outface me with leaping in her Graue?Be buried quicke with her, and so will I.And if thou prate of Mountaines; let them throwMillions of Akers on vs; till our groundSindging his pate against the burning Zone,Make Ossa like a wart. Nay, and thou'lt mouth,Ile rant as well as thou   Kin. This is meere Madnesse:And thus awhile the fit will worke on him:Anon as patient as the female Doue,When that her Golden Cuplet are disclos'd;His silence will sit drooping   Ham. Heare you Sir:What is the reason that you vse me thus?I lou'd you euer; but it is no matter:Let Hercules himselfe doe what he may,The Cat will Mew, and Dogge will haue his day.Enter.  Kin. I pray you good Horatio wait vpon him,Strengthen your patience in our last nights speech,Wee'l put the matter to the present push:Good Gertrude set some watch ouer your Sonne,This Graue shall haue a liuing Monument:An houre of quiet shortly shall we see;Till then, in patience our proceeding be.Exeunt.Enter Hamlet and Horatio   Ham. So much for this Sir; now let me see the other,You doe remember all the Circumstance   Hor. Remember it my Lord?  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kinde of fighting,That would not let me sleepe; me thought I layWorse then the mutines in the Bilboes, rashly,(And praise be rashnesse for it) let vs know,Our indiscretion sometimes serues vs well,When our deare plots do paule, and that should teach vs,There's a Diuinity that shapes our ends,Rough-hew them how we will   Hor. That is most certaine   Ham. Vp from my CabinMy sea-gowne scarft about me in the darke,Grop'd I to finde out them; had my desire,Finger'd their Packet, and in fine, withdrewTo mine owne roome againe, making so bold,(My feares forgetting manners) to vnsealeTheir grand Commission, where I found Horatio,Oh royall knauery: An exact command,Larded with many seuerall sorts of reason;Importing Denmarks health, and Englands too,With hoo, such Bugges and Goblins in my life,That on the superuize no leasure bated,No not to stay the grinding of the Axe,My head should be struck off   Hor. Ist possible?  Ham. Here's the Commission, read it at more leysure:But wilt thou heare me how I did proceed?  Hor. I beseech you   Ham. Being thus benetted round with Villaines,Ere I could make a Prologue to my braines,They had begun the Play. I sate me downe,Deuis'd a new Commission, wrote it faire,I once did hold it as our Statists doe,A basenesse to write faire; and laboured muchHow to forget that learning: but Sir now,It did me Yeomans seriuce: wilt thou knowThe effects of what I wrote?  Hor. I, good my Lord   Ham. An earnest Coniuration from the King,As England was his faithfull Tributary,As loue betweene them, as the Palme should flourish,As Peace should still her wheaten Garland weare,And stand a Comma 'tweene their amities,And many such like Assis of great charge,That on the view and know of these Contents,Without debatement further, more or lesse,He should the bearers put to sodaine death,Not shriuing time allowed   Hor. How was this seal'd?  Ham. Why, euen in that was Heauen ordinate;I had my fathers Signet in my Purse,Which was the Modell of that Danish Seale:Folded the Writ vp in forme of the other,Subscrib'd it, gau't th' impression, plac't it safely,The changeling neuer knowne: Now, the next dayWas our Sea Fight, and what to this was sement,Thou know'st already   Hor. So Guildensterne and Rosincrance, go too't   Ham. Why man, they did make loue to this imploymentThey are not neere my Conscience; their debateDoth by their owne insinuation grow:'Tis dangerous, when the baser nature comesBetweene the passe, and fell incensed pointsOf mighty opposites   Hor. Why, what a King is this?  Ham. Does it not, thinkst thee, stand me now vponHe that hath kil'd my King, and whor'd my Mother,Popt in betweene th' election and my hopes,Throwne out his Angle for my proper life,And with such coozenage; is't not perfect conscience,To quit him with this arme? And is't not to be damn'dTo let this Canker of our nature comeIn further euill   Hor. It must be shortly knowne to him from EnglandWhat is the issue of the businesse there   Ham. It will be short,The interim's mine, and a mans life's no moreThen to say one: but I am very sorry good Horatio,That to Laertes I forgot my selfe;For by the image of my Cause, I seeThe Portraiture of his; Ile count his fauours:But sure the brauery of his griefe did put meInto a Towring passion   Hor. Peace, who comes heere?Enter young Osricke.  Osr. Your Lordship is right welcome back to Denmarke   Ham. I humbly thank you Sir, dost know this waterflie?  Hor. No my good Lord   Ham. Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice toknow him: he hath much Land, and fertile; let a Beastbe Lord of Beasts, and his Crib shall stand at the KingsMesse; 'tis a Chowgh; but as I saw spacious in the possessionof dirt   Osr. Sweet Lord, if your friendship were at leysure,I should impart a thing to you from his Maiesty   Ham. I will receiue it with all diligence of spirit; putyour Bonet to his right vse, 'tis for the head   Osr. I thanke your Lordship, 'tis very hot   Ham. No, beleeue mee 'tis very cold, the winde isNortherly   Osr. It is indifferent cold my Lord indeed   Ham. Mee thinkes it is very soultry, and hot for myComplexion   Osr. Exceedingly, my Lord, it is very soultry, as 'twereI cannot tell how: but my Lord, his Maiesty bad me signifieto you, that he ha's laid a great wager on your head:Sir, this is the matter   Ham. I beseech you remember   Osr. Nay, in good faith, for mine ease in good faith:Sir, you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is athis weapon   Ham. What's his weapon?  Osr. Rapier and dagger   Ham. That's two of his weapons; but well   Osr. The sir King ha's wag'd with him six Barbary horses,against the which he impon'd as I take it, sixe FrenchRapiers and Poniards, with their assignes, as Girdle,Hangers or so: three of the Carriages infaith are verydeare to fancy, very responsiue to the hilts, most delicatecarriages, and of very liberall conceit   Ham. What call you the Carriages?  Osr. The Carriages Sir, are the hangers   Ham. The phrase would bee more Germaine to thematter: If we could carry Cannon by our sides; I wouldit might be Hangers till then; but on sixe Barbary Horsesagainst sixe French Swords: their Assignes, and threeliberall conceited Carriages, that's the French but againstthe Danish; why is this impon'd as you call it?  Osr. The King Sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes betweeneyou and him, hee shall not exceed you three hits;He hath one twelue for mine, and that would come toimediate tryall, if your Lordship would vouchsafe theAnswere   Ham. How if I answere no?  Osr. I meane my Lord, the opposition of your personin tryall   Ham. Sir, I will walke heere in the Hall; if it pleasehis Maiestie, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; letthe Foyles bee brought, the Gentleman willing, and theKing hold his purpose; I will win for him if I can: ifnot, Ile gaine nothing but my shame, and the odde hits   Osr. Shall I redeliuer you ee'n so?  Ham. To this effect Sir, after what flourish your naturewill   Osr. I commend my duty to your Lordship   Ham. Yours, yours; hee does well to commend ithimselfe, there are no tongues else for's tongue   Hor. This Lapwing runs away with the shell on hishead   Ham. He did Complie with his Dugge before heesuck't it: thus had he and mine more of the same Beautythat I know the drossie age dotes on; only got the tune ofthe time, and outward habite of encounter, a kinde ofyesty collection, which carries them through & throughthe most fond and winnowed opinions; and doe but blowthem to their tryalls: the Bubbles are out   Hor. You will lose this wager, my Lord   Ham. I doe not thinke so, since he went into France,I haue beene in continuall practice; I shall winne at theoddes: but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere aboutmy heart: but it is no matter   Hor. Nay, good my Lord   Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kinde ofgain-giuing as would perhaps trouble a woman   Hor. If your minde dislike any thing, obey. I will forestalltheir repaire hither, and say you are not fit   Ham. Not a whit, we defie Augury; there's a speciallProuidence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis notto come: if it bee not to come, it will bee now: if itbe not now; yet it will come; the readinesse is all, since noman ha's ought of what he leaues. What is't to leaue betimes?Enter King, Queene, Laertes and Lords, with other Attendants withFoyles,and Gauntlets, a Table and Flagons of Wine on it.  Kin. Come Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me   Ham. Giue me your pardon Sir, I'ue done you wrong,But pardon't as you are a Gentleman.This presence knowes,And you must needs haue heard how I am punishtWith sore distraction? What I haue doneThat might your nature honour, and exceptionRoughly awake, I heere proclaime was madnesse:Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Neuer Hamlet.If Hamlet from himselfe be tane away:And when he's not himselfe, do's wrong Laertes,Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it:Who does it then? His Madnesse? If't be so,Hamlet is of the Faction that is wrong'd,His madnesse is poore Hamlets Enemy.Sir, in this Audience,Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd euill,Free me so farre in your most generous thoughts,That I haue shot mine Arrow o're the house,And hurt my Mother   Laer. I am satisfied in Nature,Whose motiue in this case should stirre me mostTo my Reuenge. But in my termes of HonorI stand aloofe, and will no reconcilement,Till by some elder Masters of knowne Honor,I haue a voyce, and president of peaceTo keepe my name vngorg'd. But till that time,I do receiue your offer'd loue like loue,And wil not wrong it   Ham. I do embrace it freely,And will this Brothers wager frankely play.Giue vs the Foyles: Come on   Laer. Come one for me   Ham. Ile be your foile Laertes, in mine ignorance,Your Skill shall like a Starre i'th' darkest night,Sticke fiery off indeede   Laer. You mocke me Sir   Ham. No by this hand   King. Giue them the Foyles yong Osricke,Cousen Hamlet, you know the wager   Ham. Verie well my Lord,Your Grace hath laide the oddes a'th' weaker side   King. I do not feare it,I haue seene you both:But since he is better'd, we haue therefore oddes   Laer. This is too heauy,Let me see another   Ham. This likes me well,These Foyles haue all a length.Prepare to play.  Osricke. I my good Lord   King. Set me the Stopes of wine vpon that Table:If Hamlet giue the first, or second hit,Or quit in answer of the third exchange,Let all the Battlements their Ordinance fire,The King shal drinke to Hamlets better breath,And in the Cup an vnion shal he throwRicher then that, which foure successiue KingsIn Denmarkes Crowne haue worne.Giue me the Cups,And let the Kettle to the Trumpets speake,The Trumpet to the Cannoneer without,The Cannons to the Heauens, the Heauen to Earth,Now the King drinkes to Hamlet. Come, begin,And you the Iudges beare a wary eye   Ham. Come on sir   Laer. Come on sir.They play.  Ham. One   Laer. No   Ham. Iudgement   Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit   Laer. Well: againe   King. Stay, giue me drinke.Hamlet, this Pearle is thine,Here's to thy health. Giue him the cup,Trumpets sound, and shot goes off.  Ham. Ile play this bout first, set by a-while.Come: Another hit; what say you?  Laer. A touch, a touch, I do confesse   King. Our Sonne shall win   Qu. He's fat, and scant of breath.Heere's a Napkin, rub thy browes,The Queene Carowses to thy fortune, Hamlet   Ham. Good Madam   King. Gertrude, do not drinke   Qu. I will my Lord;I pray you pardon me   King. It is the poyson'd Cup, it is too late   Ham. I dare not drinke yet Madam,By and by   Qu. Come, let me wipe thy face   Laer. My Lord, Ile hit him now   King. I do not thinke't   Laer. And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience   Ham. Come for the third.Laertes, you but dally,I pray you passe with your best violence,I am affear'd you make a wanton of me   Laer. Say you so? Come on.Play.  Osr. Nothing neither way   Laer. Haue at you now.In scuffling they change Rapiers.  King. Part them, they are incens'd   Ham. Nay come, againe   Osr. Looke to the Queene there hoa   Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is't my Lord?  Osr. How is't Laertes?  Laer. Why as a WoodcockeTo mine Sprindge, Osricke,I am iustly kill'd with mine owne Treacherie   Ham. How does the Queene?  King. She sounds to see them bleede   Qu. No, no, the drinke, the drinke.Oh my deere Hamlet, the drinke, the drinke,I am poyson'd   Ham. Oh Villany! How? Let the doore be lock'd.Treacherie, seeke it out   Laer. It is heere Hamlet.Hamlet, thou art slaine,No Medicine in the world can do thee good.In thee, there is not halfe an houre of life;The Treacherous Instrument is in thy hand,Vnbated and envenom'd: the foule practiseHath turn'd it selfe on me. Loe, heere I lye,Neuer to rise againe: Thy Mothers poyson'd:I can no more, the King, the King's too blame   Ham. The point envenom'd too,Then venome to thy worke.Hurts the King.  All. Treason, Treason   King. O yet defend me Friends, I am but hurt   Ham. Heere thou incestuous, murdrous,Damned Dane,Drinke off this Potion: Is thy Vnion heere?Follow my Mother.King Dyes.  Laer. He is iustly seru'd.It is a poyson temp'red by himselfe:Exchange forgiuenesse with me, Noble Hamlet;Mine and my Fathers death come not vpon thee,Nor thine on me.Dyes.  Ham. Heauen make thee free of it, I follow thee.I am dead Horatio, wretched Queene adiew,You that looke pale, and tremble at this chance,That are but Mutes or audience to this acte:Had I but time (as this fell Sergeant deathIs strick'd in his Arrest) oh I could tell you.But let it be: Horatio, I am dead,Thou liu'st, report me and my causes rightTo the vnsatisfied   Hor. Neuer beleeue it.I am more an Antike Roman then a Dane:Heere's yet some Liquor left   Ham. As th'art a man, giue me the Cup.Let go, by Heauen Ile haue't.Oh good Horatio, what a wounded name,(Things standing thus vnknowne) shall liue behind me.If thou did'st euer hold me in thy heart,Absent thee from felicitie awhile,And in this harsh world draw thy breath in paine,To tell my Storie.March afarre off, and shout within.What warlike noyse is this?Enter Osricke.  Osr. Yong Fortinbras, with conquest come fro[m] PolandTo th' Ambassadors of England giues this warlike volly   Ham. O I dye Horatio:The potent poyson quite ore-crowes my spirit,I cannot liue to heare the Newes from England,But I do prophesie th' election lightsOn Fortinbras, he ha's my dying voyce,So tell him with the occurrents more and lesse,Which haue solicited. The rest is silence. O, o, o, o.Dyes  Hora. Now cracke a Noble heart:Goodnight sweet Prince,And flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest,Why do's the Drumme come hither?Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassador, with Drumme, Colours,andAttendants.  Fortin. Where is this sight?  Hor. What is it ye would see;If ought of woe, or wonder, cease your search   For. His quarry cries on hauocke. Oh proud death,What feast is toward in thine eternall Cell.That thou so many Princes, at a shoote,So bloodily hast strooke   Amb. The sight is dismall,And our affaires from England come too late,The eares are senselesse that should giue vs hearing,To tell him his command'ment is fulfill'd,That Rosincrance and Guildensterne are dead:Where should we haue our thankes?  Hor. Not from his mouth,Had it th' abilitie of life to thanke you:He neuer gaue command'ment for their death.But since so iumpe vpon this bloodie question,You from the Polake warres, and you from EnglandAre heere arriued. Giue order that these bodiesHigh on a stage be placed to the view,And let me speake to th' yet vnknowing world,How these things came about. So shall you heareOf carnall, bloudie, and vnnaturall acts,Of accidentall iudgements, casuall slaughtersOf death's put on by cunning, and forc'd cause,And in this vpshot, purposes mistooke,Falne on the Inuentors head. All this can ITruly deliuer   For. Let vs hast to heare it,And call the Noblest to the Audience.For me, with sorrow, I embrace my Fortune,I haue some Rites of memory in this Kingdome,Which are to claime, my vantage dothInuite me,  Hor. Of that I shall haue alwayes cause to speake,And from his mouthWhose voyce will draw on more:But let this same be presently perform'd,Euen whiles mens mindes are wilde,Lest more mischanceOn plots, and errors happen   For. Let foure CaptainesBeare Hamlet like a Soldier to the Stage,For he was likely, had he beene put onTo haue prou'd most royally:And for his passage,The Souldiours Musicke, and the rites of WarreSpeake lowdly for him.Take vp the body; Such a sight as thisBecomes the Field, but heere shewes much amis.Go, bid the Souldiers shoote.Exeunt. Marching: after the which, a Peale of Ordenance are shotoff.FINIS. The tragedie of HAMLET, Prince of Denmarke.\""
